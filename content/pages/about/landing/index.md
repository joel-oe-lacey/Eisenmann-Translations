## Translators of German, English and Other Languages – Translators for German, English, French, Spanish, Italian
We are a translation agency focusing on translations in English and German, as well as French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch and Swedish.

Established in 1990 in Pforzheim before relocating to Karlsruhe, we have used our global network of experienced translators to provide translations in all global languages. We use experienced and qualified translators/interpreters for every job, and our work is based on the mother tongue principle, whereby translators always translate into their native language.

We specialise in translations from English to German and vice versa. For such translations we almost exclusively use full-time employees.

### From Law to Medicine
Our specialist translators' chosen subject areas are law (contracts, contract law), patent systems (patent specifications and applications), medicine (in particular medical technology, radiology, urology), economics and finance (balance sheets, correspondence, tender etc.), technology (specifications, instruction manuals and guides, but mainly mechanical engineering, automotive technology, digital technology, pump technology, packaging technology), PR and advertising, IT and websites. Naturally, we also provide certified translations (i.e. contracts, statutes or registration certificates).

### Over 25 Years’ Experience

### Qualifications
Our translators are either qualified to degree level, state certified or state recognised. Engineers, doctors and lawyers also translate for us in various subject areas (technology, medicine or law).

### Languages
We work in almost all languages, but mainly English, German, French, Spanish and other European languages. Our translations from English to German and vice versa - completed on site - are subject to our four eye principle: our English translator produces the translation and another experienced translator checks it for errors.
