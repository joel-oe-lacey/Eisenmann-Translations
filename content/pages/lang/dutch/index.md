### Categorisation of Dutch
The Dutch language (Nederlandse taal), also known as Dutch or Hollandish, after the lowland region of Holland, from whose dialect today’s written Dutch developed, belongs to the Germanic branch of the Indo-European languages.

It can be said that Dutch was derived from Low Frankonian - a branch of Low German - which  developed in the “lowlands of France” (northwest of the Benrath Line).

Indo-European linguistics and German studies classify Dutch as a western branch of Low German, along with Low Saxon and the East Low German branch of the German language.

### The Spread of Dutch
Dutch was originally spoken in the Netherlands, the Flemish region of Belgium, Brussels and the French and German regions bordering the Netherlands.

There are approximately 25 million native speakers of Dutch, and it is an official language in the Netherlands, Belgium, Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles.

The Dutch themselves frequently refer to their native language as Hollandish, although that term actually denotes a larger group of dialects. However, modern standard Dutch was greatly influenced by the dialects of the once-strongest federal state of Holland (now the provinces of North and South Holland), whereas beyond Brabant it is difficult to find any traces of the dialects of the other early federal states.

### Language Variants
As their native language, many Dutch people speak the Low Saxon (Low German) dialects that are spread across northern Germany, which are indirectly derived from the Old Saxon language. They learn Dutch at school and refer to it as Hollandish.

On the other hand, the original German Lower Rhinian, western Ruhr area and Bergische Land dialects are Low Frankonian or Dutch. For example, the South Guelderish dialects are unanimously considered to be Dutch dialects. Until into the 19th Century, Dutch was the working language in most schools in today’s Kleve district.

The Flemish people in Belgium, however, speak Flemish dialects of Dutch where standard Dutch is an official language in Belgium.
