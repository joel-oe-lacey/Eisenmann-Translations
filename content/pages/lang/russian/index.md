### The Spread of Russian
The Russian language - known in the past as Great Russian – is the most commonly spoken Slavic language. Approximately 180 million people are native speakers of Russian, around 130 million of whom live in Russia.

Russian, together with Ukrainian, Belarusian and Ruthenian, forms the eastern Slavic language group.

Russian is an official language in Russia, Belarus (along with Belarusian), Kazakhstan (along with Kazakh) and the Republic of Crimea (which belongs to the Ukraine), alongside Ukrainian. In these countries and others of the former Soviet Union (i.e. Latvia and Estonia), Russian is the mother tongue of a part of the population and an important element of public life.

Russian is also a well-disseminated language for science, art and technology.

### Particularities of Russian
Russian is written in the Cyrillic alphabet and, like most Slavic languages, is highly inflective. The three grammatical genders in Russian are distinguished by animate (i.e. people) and inanimate (i.e. other) substantives.

Unlike German, Russian has six different cases. In addition to the nominative, genitive, dative and accusative cases used in German, Russian also includes the instrumental and prepositional (also called locative) cases. The use of cases in Russian differs greatly from German and English, i.e. in Russian, ages are normally given in the dative case.

Russian is a non-tonal language. This means that the tone pitch has absolutely no influence on the meaning of a word. Russian pronunciation distinguishes between hard and soft consonants.

The Russian equivalent of the verb “to be” is only conjugated in the past and future tenses. Exceptions aside, this verb is simply not used in the present tense. Therefore, there are almost no copulas in Russian today (i.e. "I am small").

The constantly growing significance of Russian on the global market is also reflected in the demand for Russian translators and interpreters. For a few years now in Germany, translation and interpretation degree courses have been on offer in Russian.
