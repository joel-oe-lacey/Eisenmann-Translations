### The Spread of French
The French language belongs to the Romantic group of Indo-European languages. Currently, it is spoken as a native language by around 77 million people, in for example France, Canada, Belgium and Switzerland. Factor in all the people who speak French as a second language, and we reach around 130 million speakers worldwide.

The French language is the official language in around 30 countries, including Belgium, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cameroon and the Central African Republic. The wide dissemination of French, even on the African continent, can be traced to the colonial age.

### The History of French
The roots of French can be found in the 9th Century in Celtic and Latin. The French language has been constantly changing since the Early Middle Ages: it evolved from Old French (9th - 14th Century) into Middle French (14th - 16th Century), and then to New French (16th Century onwards) before becoming the modern language it is today. The French language, which replaced Latin as the language of international communication in the 16th and 17th Centuries – particularly as the language of diplomacy and of the aristocracy, i.e. in Germany - , is still today one of the most significant international languages.

### Particularities of French
Unlike other languages (such as German), only a few terms have been borrowed from English and kept the same spelling and pronunciation. The majority of these borrowed terms were assimilated into the French language system of spelling and pronunciation. Some examples are “boxe” (“boxing”), “bouledogue” (“bulldog”) and “rosbif” (“roast beef”).

French is one of the main working languages of organisations such as the United Nations and the European Parliament.

These organisations employ a large number of translators and interpreters, and translations to and from French naturally constitute a large portion of the workload for these linguists.

Due to the great importance of French, there is great demand for French translations in all subject areas.
