### The Spread of Bulgarian
Bulgarian is an Indo-European language, categorised as an East Slavic language. Bulgarian is currently spoken by 7.3 million people in Bulgaria, and from 1.7 million more people outside of Bulgaria in the Ukraine, Romania, Belarus, Republic of Moldavia and Greece.

The first records of written Bulgarian date back to the 9th Century AD, and are in the Glagolitic alphabet, which was not retained. Today, Bulgarian is written only in the Cyrillic alphabet. Because writings in other languages were translated into Bulgarian in the past in order to convert them into text form and bring them to other countries, Bulgaria can be seen as the country in which the cornerstone of Slavic Orthodox society was laid.

Bulgarian contains many borrowed words from Turkish which are frequently used in the spoken language, despite governmental attempts at replacing them with borrowed words from Russian.
