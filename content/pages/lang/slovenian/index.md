### The History of Slovenian
Slovenian belongs to the South Slavic languages of the Indo-Germanic language family. Approximately 2 million people speak Slovenian as a mother tongue, the majority of whom live in Slovenia. However, there are also minorities in Northeast Italy, Western Hungary and Croatia, as well as in Carinthia.

Slovenian was born from Proto-Slavic which evolved before the 9th Century. From this Proto-Slavic, Old Slavic appeared in the 9th Century and was almost exclusively used as a written language, and which was the basis for the Church Slavonic developed from the 11th Century onwards.

From the 13th Century onwards, Slovenia fell under the rule of the House of Habsburg, and in 1867 it became a part of the multinational state of Austria-Hungary. Due to the dominance of the House of Habsburg, Slovenian became the dominant language and German became the language of administration and science. At the beginning of the 20th Century, a national movement began which endeavoured to de-Germanise the language, and to find Slovenian equivalents for German terms. In 1918, Slovenia became part of the Kingdom of Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia, and it was endeavoured to create a common written language. In order to preserve the Slovenian language, a language academy was founded.

Today, Slovenian is an independent language encompassing 7 dialects spoken by the various minorities in Italy, Carinthia and Hungary.

As of 1st May 2004, Slovenian has been an official language of the European Union.
