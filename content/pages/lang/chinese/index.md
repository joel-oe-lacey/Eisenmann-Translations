### The History of Chinese
The Chinese language is a sub-group of the Sino-Tibetan languages, and is the most significant member of this language family.

Due to its wide distribution and its almost three millennia-long history, Chinese has been subjected to so many external influences that there are probably several languages absorbed in it. Chinese is not an individual language, rather it is divided into various "dialects" which differ from one another at least as greatly as the Romance languages. Therefore, most linguists prefer to speak of the "Sinitic languages". In linguistics, Chinese is now recognised as a group comprised of six languages.

In fact, it would be almost impossible for a speaker of Mandarin Chinese to understand a speaker of, for example, Cantonese. The only possible means of communication is the standard Chinese language P?t?nghu?, and the Chinese script which is used all across China, which can be understood since it is a logographic script independent of pronunciation rules. On a regional level, variations can arise due to the influences of the various "dialects".

### Spread
Worldwide, there are estimated to be 1.2 billion people who are native speakers of one of the variants of Chinese. Most of these people live in China (the People's Republic of China and Taiwan) but many also live in Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia. In the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan and Singapore, Chinese is an official language.

Mandarin Chinese, as it is known (B?if?nghu? = “the language of the north”) is, with 850 million native speakers, by far the most widely spread and commonly spoken variant of Chinese.

Alongside Mandarin Chinese there are Gan (20 million speakers), Hakka (30 million speakers), Jinyu (45 million speakers), Min Mei (10 million speakers), Min Nan (40 million speakers), Wu (inc. Shanghainese, ca. 77 million speakers), Xiang (36 million speakers) und Yue (Cantonese, over 80 million speakers).

### Particularities of Chinese
The Chinese languages belong to the so-called isolating languages; the words do not change based on declination or conjugation, rather stand next to each other as isolated units. Number, case and tense are only expressed in cases of unclear context through added indicatory words. Usage arises from the context, and the indicator is not normally used.

While every syllable in classic Chinese is also a morpheme, in modern Chinese many two or three-syllable words may only theoretically be broken up into several morphemes because their long, frequent use in their multi-syllable form have caused them to no longer be found as individual words set together.

Furthermore, the Chinese languages are tone languages. This means that the tone pitch and its course during pronunciation of the word can change the word's meaning. The different variants of Chinese have a different number of tones: Mandarin Chinese has 4-5 tones, Wu (Shanghai dialect) has only 2 tones, Cantonese (Yue; spoken in Guangdong and Hong Kong) has 6 tones and Min Nan has 8.

In addition to the Chinese script, there are nowadays individual Romance systems for Mandarin Chinese and all other Chinese languages.

The Chinese language has had enormous influence on the development of other Asian languages, in particular Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese.
