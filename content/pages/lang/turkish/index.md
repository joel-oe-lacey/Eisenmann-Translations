### The Spread of Turkish
Turkish belongs to the Turkic languages, and is an official language in Turkey and Cyprus. Modern Turkish is the mother tongue of approximately 65 million people in Turkey and 15 million Turks living mainly in Bulgaria, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Greece, Belgium, Austria, Romania or Germany.

Turkish is an agglutinative language, and therefore differs from the Indo-European languages. Agglutinative languages indicate all grammatical forms through one (unambiguous) ending. This means that several endings can follow one another, establishing a sequence. Just as with Finnish, Turkish contains no grammatical genders. Turkish also contains no definite articles and five cases.

### The History of Turkish
Modern Turkish belongs to the South Turkic language group, and traces directly back to the Oghuz language; the language of the eastern Turk tribes.

Over the centuries, Turkish has been subjected to strong influences from Persian and Arabic; at one point almost 20% of the Turkish vocabulary consisted of words of Persian or Arabic origins.

After the founding of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, the Turks began to replace the borrowed words in Turkish. This process is still not complete, so some words of Persian or Arabic origins are still used in Turkish today. Over the course of the 20th Century, Turkish absorbed many words from European languages, in particular from French.

After the Islamisation of the Oghuz people, the written Arabic language was adopted and expanded with Persian characters. This alphabet was, however, not suited for the Turkish language.

Since 1928, Turkish has been written in a variation of the Latin alphabet, developed by Kemal Atatürk himself. He named this new writing system the new Turkish alphabet. Therefore, the current Turkish alphabet is comprised of 29 letters, whereby each letter is assigned to a sound.

The Istanbul dialect formed the basis for the new way of writing the words and for the general language reform. There are many Turkish dialects, and the Istanbul dialect counts as the standard language. Other Turkish dialects include the Black Sea dialect, the Agaean dialect and the dialect spoken in the east of Turkey.

Turkish is most closely related to Azerbaijani and Turkmen. The Balkan-Turkish dialect Gagauz in today’s Republic of Moldavia is also a relative of Turkish.

The “Türk Dil Kurumu”, or the Turkish Language Association, is a national facility opened on 12th July 1932 under Kemal Atatürk. Its task is to restructure, modernise and standardise the Turkish language. To this end, words borrowed from Persian, Arabic and other languages are replaced by new Turkish creations. These new terms are then called “Öztürkçe“ (‘proper Turkish’) and disseminated through dictionaries and the media.

The Turkish Language Association also operates an active language policy; also an expression of the position of the dominant politics and speakers. This means that significant conclusions may be drawn regarding a speaker’s political stance based on either his/her acceptance and use of newly-created terms or retention of older words in communication.
