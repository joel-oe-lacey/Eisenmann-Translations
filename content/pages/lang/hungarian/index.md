### The Spread of Hungarian
Hungarian (‘Magyar nyelv’) is the only non Indo-European language spoken in Central Europe. Together with Finnish, Estonian, Sami and other languages spoken in European Russia and North Siberia, Hungarian belongs to the Finno-Ugric languages. In turn, the Finno-Ugric languages together with the small group of Samoyedic languages form the Uralic language family.

Hungarian is spoken by approximately 15 million people today, and is the official language of Hungary.

### The History of Hungarian
The first writings in Hungarian date back to the 9th Century, when the Magyars still used Hungarian runic characters.

Together with the Khanty and Mansi peoples; two peoples living east of the Ural Mountains, the Hungarians form the Hungarian subgroup.

There were various approaches in the attempt to prove the origins of Hungarian. This caused Hungarian to often be categorised in the Turkish language group. This theory was underpinned by the fact that both languages are agglutinative and based on vocal harmonies. Even the name “Hungar” is related to the term “Onogur” which was given to Hungary by the Slavs. However, the difference to Hungary’s own designation - Magyar - is striking.

From the 12th Century onwards in Hungary, the legend (Hunor and Magor) spread that the people were descended from the Huns. This, however, is not the case. It is much more logical to assume a common Hungarian migration with the Huns and Goths. Others in this mix of peoples did not take the time to differentiate, and so called all the people Huns. The name ‘Atilla’ (Gothic and Hun origins, meaning “Dad”) remains to this day a highly popular first name for males in Hungary.

The Hungarian language, which contains but a few word similarities to the Indo-European languages, appears at first to be difficult to learn. This has ensured that Hungary, despite being subjected to several foreign rules (i.e. Austria) in the course of its history, has retained a certain cultural autonomy.

Since Hungary’s ascension into the European Union on 1st May 2004, Hungarian has not only been an official language in Hungary but one of the official languages of the EU, causing Hungarian to have grown in importance on a European stage.
