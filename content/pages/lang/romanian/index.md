### The Spread of Romanian
Romanian is spoken by over 26 million people, most of whom reside in Romania and the Republic of Moldova, where Romanian is also the official language. However, there are also speakers of Romanian in Bulgaria, Hungary, the Ukraine and a region of Serbia (Vojvodina).

Romanian belongs to the Balkan-Romance languages of the Indo-European language family. It displays many similarities to the languages of surrounding regions; mainly Italian. Unlike Italian, however, Romanian has absorbed words and phonetic symbols from Slavic, so that Romanians are normally able to understand basic Italian. However, Romanian remains difficult for Italian people to understand.

As with all Romance languages, Romanian can be traced directly back to Vulgar Latin. Today, Romanian is no longer reproduced in the Cyrillic alphabet, rather in Latin with some additional special characters.
