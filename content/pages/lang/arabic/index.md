### The History of Arabic
Arabic comprises a number of different language forms spoken both today and in the past 1500 years. All of these language forms are brought together into one language, mainly by Islam and in particular by the Koran. The language of the Koran - Classical Arabic - spread from the centre of the Arabian Peninsula - Hijaz - through Islamic conquests across the entire Middle East. In the last ten years of the 6th Century, Kalif Abd al-Malik raised this form of Arabic to the status of official administrative language of the Islamic Empire.

### The Spread of Arabic
Arabic belongs to the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asian language tree, and is the native language of approx. 250 million people. Arabic is also an official language in the following countries: Arabia, Israel, Yemen, Comoros, Jordan, Qatar, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Mauritania, Oman, the Autonomous Palestinian Territories, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Chad, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates.

Arabic is also one of the six official languages of the United Nations.

### Dialects
The Arabic dialects spoken in the various countries differ so greatly that they are often mutually either difficult or impossible to understand. This is the reason why, for example, Algerian films are to some extent subtitled in standard Arabic when screened in the Gulf States.

Today, there are no native speakers of Classical Arabic; it is merely used (with a different vocabulary) as a standard written language in which almost all books and newspapers are written (except in Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria, where French and Arabic have the same status). In the other Arabic countries, English is often used in scientific and technological texts due to Arabic’s lacking vocabulary.

This modern form of standard Arabic, merely intended for use as a written language, is often spoken on official occasions and on TV and radio. Modern Arabic mainly differs from Classical Arabic in pronunciation and vocabulary, as well as (depending on the speaker’s education) grammar.

The question of whether to consider standard Arabic a modern standard language is very controversial. Modern standard Arabic generally lacks a standard vocabulary for a myriad of objects in the modern world, and it also lacks a technical vocabulary for many scientific/technological fields. Additionally, modern standard Arabic is hardly used in the Arabic-speaking countries for spoken communication.

However, spoken standard Arabic has recently become more significant. This development is due in no small part to the TV broadcaster Aljazeera in Qatar, which airs lively discussions between speakers from all parts of the Arabic-speaking world who try to encourage the use of a language similar to standard Arabic.

Nevertheless, the spoken Cairo dialect of Arabic is generally understandable due to the dominant Egyptian film and TV industry (required by the large Egyptian population). It is also unusual to film entertainment films in standard Arabic because this language tends to be reserved for serious topics, such as TV and radio news and religious programmes and services.
