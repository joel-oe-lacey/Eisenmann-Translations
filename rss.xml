&lt;p&gt;All texts are translated by experienced specialist translators of Swedish into their mother tongues (Swedish or German), as per the native speaker principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Spread of Swedish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Swedish language (“Svenska”), alongside Norwegian, Danish, Icelandic and Faroese, makes up the group of Skandinavian languages (also known as North Germanic or Northern languages), and is derived from the Germanic languages which are a part of the Indo-European language tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swedish is the mother tongue of approximately 8.5 million people, the majority of whom live in Sweden. In Finland, which until 1809 belonged to Sweden, Swedish is one of the two official languages, and today approximately 300,000 native speakers of Swedish (6% of the population) live there - around 25,000 of these live on the exclusively Swedish-speaking Aland Islands. In Aland and Finland, Swedish is an official language, and in Finland it is even taught as a compulsory subject at school. Curiously, Swedish is not legally an official language in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Particularities of Swedish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pronunciation of Swedish is known for its distinctive system of vocals, whereby longer and shorter vocals change the meanings of words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike German and English which only have a stress accent, words in Swedish are either spoken with a stress accent or with a musical/melodious accent. As in Norwegian, this accent can change the meanings of words. There are also regional differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only existent case in Swedish is the genitive, even though traces of the accusative (used in the past) can still be found. The genitive is formed by adding an ‘s’ suffix which is not added if the substantive already ends with an ‘s’. The substantive follows after the genitive, always in the indeterminate form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eisenmann Übersetzungsteam provides technical translations by native speakers of Turkish into and from Turkish for all subject areas: economics, law, technology, medicine, advertising, IT etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our subject areas range from finance to law, from technology to advertising, websites, certificates and references.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All texts are translated by experienced specialist translators of Turkish into their mother tongues (Turkish or German), as per the native speaker principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Spread of Turkish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkish belongs to the Turkic languages, and is an official language in Turkey and Cyprus. Modern Turkish is the mother tongue of approximately 65 million people in Turkey and 15 million Turks living mainly in Bulgaria, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Greece, Belgium, Austria, Romania or Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkish is an agglutinative language, and therefore differs from the Indo-European languages. Agglutinative languages indicate all grammatical forms through one (unambiguous) ending. This means that several endings can follow one another, establishing a sequence. Just as with Finnish, Turkish contains no grammatical genders. Turkish also contains no definite articles and five cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The History of Turkish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern Turkish belongs to the South Turkic language group, and traces directly back to the Oghuz language; the language of the eastern Turk tribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the centuries, Turkish has been subjected to strong influences from Persian and Arabic; at one point almost 20% of the Turkish vocabulary consisted of words of Persian or Arabic origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the founding of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, the Turks began to replace the borrowed words in Turkish. This process is still not complete, so some words of Persian or Arabic origins are still used in Turkish today. Over the course of the 20th Century, Turkish absorbed many words from European languages, in particular from French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Islamisation of the Oghuz people, the written Arabic language was adopted and expanded with Persian characters. This alphabet was, however, not suited for the Turkish language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 1928, Turkish has been written in a variation of the Latin alphabet, developed by Kemal Atatürk himself. He named this new writing system the new Turkish alphabet. Therefore, the current Turkish alphabet is comprised of 29 letters, whereby each letter is assigned to a sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Istanbul dialect formed the basis for the new way of writing the words and for the general language reform. There are many Turkish dialects, and the Istanbul dialect counts as the standard language. Other Turkish dialects include the Black Sea dialect, the Agaean dialect and the dialect spoken in the east of Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkish is most closely related to Azerbaijani and Turkmen. The Balkan-Turkish dialect Gagauz in today’s Republic of Moldavia is also a relative of Turkish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Türk Dil Kurumu”, or the Turkish Language Association, is a national facility opened on 12th July 1932 under Kemal Atatürk. Its task is to restructure, modernise and standardise the Turkish language. To this end, words borrowed from Persian, Arabic and other languages are replaced by new Turkish creations. These new terms are then called “Öztürkçe“ (‘proper Turkish’) and disseminated through dictionaries and the media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turkish Language Association also operates an active language policy; also an expression of the position of the dominant politics and speakers. This means that significant conclusions may be drawn regarding a speaker’s political stance based on either his/her acceptance and use of newly-created terms or retention of older words in communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All texts are translated by experienced specialist translators of Slovenian into their mother tongues (Slovenian or German), as per the native speaker principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The History of Slovenian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slovenian belongs to the South Slavic languages of the Indo-Germanic language family. Approximately 2 million people speak Slovenian as a mother tongue, the majority of whom live in Slovenia. However, there are also minorities in Northeast Italy, Western Hungary and Croatia, as well as in Carinthia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slovenian was born from Proto-Slavic which evolved before the 9th Century. From this Proto-Slavic, Old Slavic appeared in the 9th Century and was almost exclusively used as a written language, and which was the basis for the Church Slavonic developed from the 11th Century onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 13th Century onwards, Slovenia fell under the rule of the House of Habsburg, and in 1867 it became a part of the multinational state of Austria-Hungary. Due to the dominance of the House of Habsburg, Slovenian became the dominant language and German became the language of administration and science. At the beginning of the 20th Century, a national movement began which endeavoured to de-Germanise the language, and to find Slovenian equivalents for German terms. In 1918, Slovenia became part of the Kingdom of Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia, and it was endeavoured to create a common written language. In order to preserve the Slovenian language, a language academy was founded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Slovenian is an independent language encompassing 7 dialects spoken by the various minorities in Italy, Carinthia and Hungary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 1st May 2004, Slovenian has been an official language of the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The History of Ukrainian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian is the official language of the Ukraine, where it is spoken by more than 31 million people. An additional 16 million native speakers live in over 25 countries including Russia, Poland, Slovakia, the USA, Canada and Belarus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian, like Russian, belongs to the East Slavic languages and evolved in the 9th Century from Proto-Slavic in the region of Kievan Rus’. Because ‘Russian’ is mistakenly assumed from ‘Rus’, Russian was named Great Russian and Ukrainian was named Lesser Russian. In the 18th Century, an independent Ukrainian written and literature language finally emerged. Around the end of the 19th Century and later in the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian language stood below Russian in importance. Ukrainian was still spoken, but it was not the lingua franca. Even today, the Russian influence on the language variants of Ukrainian is still visibly apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian has been the official language of the Ukraine since 1991.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All texts are translated by experienced specialist translators of Vietnamese into their mother tongues (Vietnamese or German), as per the native speaker principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The History of Vietnamese&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of Vietnamese is not clear, and linguists are not agreed on how to classify the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vietnamese is an official language in Vietnam, where it is spoken by all inhabitants, that is to say 72 million people. This is augmented by the 2-3 million emigrants living in Poland, Germany, Canada, Australia and the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vietnamese belongs to the Austro-Asiatic language family, under which it is categorised under the Proto-Mon-Khmer language. This means that Vietnamese is categorised as a non-tonal language, although it is one. This is based on the theory that Vietnamese was originally a non-tonal language in which 6 tones formed over time, which were then adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a linguistic theory, in the past there existed a sort of Proto-Vietnamese which was similar to the other languages of the same language family. Over time, Vietnamese evolved further and adopted characteristics of the languages of the Thai family. This development took place in the north of the country and gradually spread to the south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the following 1000-year Chinese rule, a sort of Sino-Vietnamese formed which was distinguished by many borrowed Chinese words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the end of the Chinese rule, Vietnamese evolved away from Chinese and towards the Romance languages. Old Vietnamese was still characterised by the Chinese typeface with some changes, while the Middle Vietnamese which developed from the 17th Century onwards was strongly influenced by French; even more so around the end of the 19th Century when Vietnam became a French colony with French as the official language and working language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since gaining independence, Vietnamese has been written in Latin letters with special characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Spread of Spanish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spanish language belongs to the Romance branch of Indo-European languages. It is often categorised together with Catalan and Portuguese as an Ibero-Romance language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written Spanish was characterised mainly by the use of language in the central Spanish region of Castile, and in order to keep the language separate from the other language variants spoken in Spain, in particular Galician and Catalan, High Spanish was termed the Castilian language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latin letters are used in Spanish, yet the modern language also features acute accents for pronunciation purposes, and uses the letters ñ and ü.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide there are around 360 million people whose mother tongue is Spanish, living in (for example) Spain, Mexico, Columbia, Argentina, Nicaragua, Chile, the USA, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Cuba and Peru. Add to this the people who speak Spanish as a second language and we get roughly 420 million speakers worldwide. Spanish is an official language in the following countries: Equatorial Guinea, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Cuba, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Equador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Columbia, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela and the USA. It is also an official language in the European and African Unions, as well as in the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, Spanish is the fourth most-commonly spoken language in the world after Mandarin Chinese, Hindi and English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The History of Spanish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we consider the historical development of Spanish, we can say that it has been characterised by numerous influences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula (to our knowledge) were the Iberians; a people of African origins. In around 600 BC, the Celts crossed the Pyrenees and mixed with the Iberians to form the so-called Celtiberians. Basque, spoken by around 850,000 people in the Bay of Biscay on both sides of the Franco-Spanish border, is the only linguistic remnant of that age, termed the Pre-Roman Era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 3rd Century onwards, the Romans began the conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, and until the Gothic invasion in 414 people across the entire Iberian Peninsula spoke local variations. Although the Goths controlled Spain for over 300 years, they had relatively little influence on the language and on social life. There are, therefore, only a few words of German origins to be found in Spanish today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conquest of Spain by the Arabs, who in 711 began an expansion out of Africa to the east and north of the peninsula, brought with it a deep-reaching and permanent influence on the Spanish language. For several centuries the Arabs ruled all of Spain, and when the reconquest of Spain was brought to a close in 1492 with the fall of Granada, many Arabic elements had already seeped into Spanish. Borrowed Arabic words include “aceite” (“oil”) and “aceituna” (“olive”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reforms introduced by Ferdinand III (1217-1252) and Alfonso X (1252-1282) were of great linguistic significance. These reforms abolished Latin as the language of documents and replaced it with Castilian. After the union of the Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon in 1479, Castilian became the national language of the Kingdom of Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Language Variants of Spanish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One variant of Spanish is Judaeo-Spanish, or Ladino. This was the language spoken by the Sephardim; Jews expelled from Spain in 1492. They now live in Greece, Turkey, Israel, North Morocco and the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we have to distinguish between the Spanish spoken on the Iberian Peninsula and Argentinean Spanish, American Spanish, Spanglish and the variation of American Spanish spoken in the Spanish-speaking countries of Middle and South America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through its wide dissemination as the fourth most-commonly spoken language in the world, Spanish is not just one of the main working languages of all European and international organisations such as the European Parliament and the United Nations, but also one of the most-commonly translated and interpreted languages in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The History of Slovak&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slovak belongs to the West Slavic languages of the Indo-European language group. There are approximately 5 million native speakers of Slovak in Slovakia, in addition to approximately one million emigrants in Canada and the USA, as well as minorities in the Ukraine, Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary and Romania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slovak developed from the Slovene language in the 10th Century. Because the region of Slovakia belonged to the Kingdom of Hungary in the 10th Century, Latin, German and Hungarian became the major languages for administration and business. From the 14th Century onwards, Czech (which was tinted with Slovak, making it a sort of ‘Slovakised’ Czech) was spoken increasingly often. At around the end of the 19th Century, Slovak was eventually codified, giving rise to the use of a simple written language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to its history and the country’s former inclusion in the Kingdom of Hungary, Slovak contains a range of words borrowed from Czech, German, Latin and other European languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Slovakia joined the European Union on 1st May 2004, the importance of Slovak grew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Spread of Russian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russian language - known in the past as Great Russian – is the most commonly spoken Slavic language. Approximately 180 million people are native speakers of Russian, around 130 million of whom live in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian, together with Ukrainian, Belarusian and Ruthenian, forms the eastern Slavic language group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian is an official language in Russia, Belarus (along with Belarusian), Kazakhstan (along with Kazakh) and the Republic of Crimea (which belongs to the Ukraine), alongside Ukrainian. In these countries and others of the former Soviet Union (i.e. Latvia and Estonia), Russian is the mother tongue of a part of the population and an important element of public life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian is also a well-disseminated language for science, art and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Particularities of Russian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian is written in the Cyrillic alphabet and, like most Slavic languages, is highly inflective. The three grammatical genders in Russian are distinguished by animate (i.e. people) and inanimate (i.e. other) substantives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike German, Russian has six different cases. In addition to the nominative, genitive, dative and accusative cases used in German, Russian also includes the instrumental and prepositional (also called locative) cases. The use of cases in Russian differs greatly from German and English, i.e. in Russian, ages are normally given in the dative case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian is a non-tonal language. This means that the tone pitch has absolutely no influence on the meaning of a word. Russian pronunciation distinguishes between hard and soft consonants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russian equivalent of the verb “to be” is only conjugated in the past and future tenses. Exceptions aside, this verb is simply not used in the present tense. Therefore, there are almost no copulas in Russian today (i.e. “I am small”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The constantly growing significance of Russian on the global market is also reflected in the demand for Russian translators and interpreters. For a few years now in Germany, translation and interpretation degree courses have been on offer in Russian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Spread of Portuguese&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portuguese belongs to the Indo-European group of the Romance branch of language, and together with Spanish and Catalan forms the Ibero-Romance languages. Just like Galician, spoken in northwest Spain, Portuguese can be traced to the original Galician-Portuguese language which developed between ancient times and the Early Middle Ages. After the rise of a Portugal independent of Spain, both of today’s languages developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portuguese is spoken by approx. 190 million native speakers, living in for example Portugal, Brazil, Angola, Cape Verde, Timor-Leste, Guinea-Bissau, Macau, Mozambique, Namibia, São Tomé and Principe, India, South Africa and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add in the people who speak Portuguese as a second language, and we get approx. 200 million speakers worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portuguese is an official language in Portugal, Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, São Tomé and Principe, Timor-Leste and Macau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The History of Portuguese&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, Portuguese only existed as a spoken language, while people used Latin when writing. Although the land which today makes up Portugal was inhabited before the arrival of the Romans, 90% of the Portuguese vocabulary stems from Latin, and there are now very few traces of the original language to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest records of a written form of Portuguese are “Cancioneiros” from the year 1100. Like Spanish, Portuguese was influenced by the Germanic invasions which took place from the 5th Century onwards, and by the Moorish invasion of 711.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Germanic elements entered Portuguese in two ways: indirectly as borrowed Germanic words which had become part of the colloquial Latin spoken by Roman legionaries on the Iberian Peninsula, and directly as borrowed words of Gothic and Suebian origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arabic influence can mainly be traced to the status of Arabic as an administrative language in the conquered areas of the Iberian Peninsula. However, the population continued to speak in its Romance dialect, causing the influence of Arabic on Portuguese not to be very strong, yet some lexical structures still link to Arabic. Thus, some words in modern Portuguese are of Arabic origin, mainly from the fields of food and agriculture, since the Arabs brought such innovations with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the formation of the independent Kingdom of Portugal in 1139, Portuguese gradually became a written language. By the 14th Century, Portuguese was already a developed language with a rich literary tradition, and in the 15th Century, as Portugal began to slowly build its colonial empire up until 1975, Portuguese began to spread across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Portuguese colonial empire stretched from Brazil to Macau in China. In the 16th Century, Portuguese was the lingua franca in Africa and Asia, where it served not only for colonial administration but also for trade and communication between the rulers and Europeans of all nationalities. This is the reason why Portuguese today is an official language in several independent states, and why so many people speak it as a second language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside Portuguese proper, there are around 20 Creole languages which are mostly based on Portuguese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portuguese became a significant minority language in several states in Western Europe and North America due to emigration out of Portugal over the past few centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Language Variants of Portuguese&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portuguese native speakers mostly do not call their dialects as such, rather as accents (“sotaques”) or pronunciations (“pronúncia”), because the term ‘dialect’ has derogatory connotations in Portuguese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Portuguese - also known as Estremenho – has changed more over the course of history than other language variants. Nowadays, there are generally considered to be two forms of standard Portuguese; standard Portuguese from Portugal, so-called European Portuguese – often the language of choice in Portugal’s earlier African colonies - and standard Portuguese from Brazil. However, there are generally considered to be four standard pronunciations of Portuguese: those of Coimbra, Lisbon, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. These four forms are the most influential pronunciation forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portuguese is an official language of the European Union, Mercosul, the African Union and several other organisations. The significance of Portuguese has increased tremendously in recent decades, and Portuguese enjoys constantly increasing popularity in many countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minimum price for a translation is €30, excluding VAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Spread of Polish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polish is the official language of Poland, and is spoken by approximately 60 million native speakers. This includes large Polish minorities in Lithuania, Belarus, the Ukraine, Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union, the Czech Republic, the USA, Canada, Germany and France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Polish language (poln, jezyk, polski) belongs to the West Slavic languages; a subgroup of the Indo-European language tree, and it is closely related to Czech, Slovakian and Sorbian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several Polish dialects including Lesser Polish (Southeast Poland and Krakow), Silesian (in the Southwest), Masovian (Northeast Poland and Warsaw) and Great Polish (in the north and west). Kashubian (in the north) is called a dialect, particularly in literature, but in fact it is an independent West Slavic language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The History of Polish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oldest known records of the Polish language and script date back to the 12th Century. These were names and commentaries in the “Bull of Gniezno”, by Pope Innocent II in the year 1136.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In later times, many religious texts were transferred from Latin to Polish, and in the 15th Century the earlier influence of Czech was gradually pushed back, and written Polish was able to free itself as far as possible from Latin. Until the 16th Century, Polish was predominantly written by chaplains, after which time it noticeably spread in the nobility and middle classes. In the course of the 16th Century, the modern Polish language of literature developed, based on the dialects spoken in the region of Poznan (in western Poland). Examples of writings from this time period are the literature of Till Eulenspiegel and the prose of Mikolaj Rej.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, Polish had the tendency to borrow words from Old Czech, Middle High German and Latin; nowadays borrowed words in Polish mainly stem from Ukrainian, Belarusian, German, French and English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Particularities of Polish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polish phonology consists of 6 vowels and 34 consonants which are reproduced in an edited Latin alphabet, adjusted to the phonetic requirements of Polish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One particular characteristic of Polish is the “I” which is pronounced similarly to English. The difference between long and short vowels was lost over the course of the language’s development, and the word stress was affixed to the last syllable. As an individual Slavic language, Polish contains nasalised vowels (a and e) which developed from the Old Slavic nasalised vowels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in almost all Slavic languages, the so-called “dual” - originally present in Polish - has been lost, so that the Polish language of today only has one singular and one plural. The singular has three genders; masculine, feminine and neuter, while in the plural there is one additional category reserved for male people, which differs from the general plural forms for animate and inanimate subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polish has retained the Old Slavic case system, and contains six cases for substantive, pronouns, adjectives and a seventh case only used in direct addresses for substantives and pronouns; the vocative. The flexion of the verbs in Polish is based on person, number and gender. The Polish tense system was simplified when the three original tenses - aorist, imperfect and pluperfect - were removed. In modern Polish, the so-called Slavic perfect is the only past tense form used in everyday language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, it can be said that Polish has a very free word order system in comparison to other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularly through Poland’s ascension into the European Union on 1st May 2004 and the resulting opening of Poland’s market to western states, the importance of Polish has grown enormously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All texts are translated by experienced specialist translators of Romanian into their mother tongues (Romanian or German), as per the native speaker principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Spread of Romanian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romanian is spoken by over 26 million people, most of whom reside in Romania and the Republic of Moldova, where Romanian is also the official language. However, there are also speakers of Romanian in Bulgaria, Hungary, the Ukraine and a region of Serbia (Vojvodina).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romanian belongs to the Balkan-Romance languages of the Indo-European language family. It displays many similarities to the languages of surrounding regions; mainly Italian. Unlike Italian, however, Romanian has absorbed words and phonetic symbols from Slavic, so that Romanians are normally able to understand basic Italian. However, Romanian remains difficult for Italian people to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all Romance languages, Romanian can be traced directly back to Vulgar Latin. Today, Romanian is no longer reproduced in the Cyrillic alphabet, rather in Latin with some additional special characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All texts are translated by experienced specialist translators of Persian into their mother tongues (Persian or German), as per the native speaker principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Spread of Persian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persian (Farsi) is an official language in Iran and Tadzhikistan, with over 65 million speakers. It is also spoken in Afghanistan, Iraq, India and Uzbekistan, as well as in parts of Europe and North America. In total, there are over 100 million speakers of Persian worldwide, which is why Persian is portrayed as the most important language in southwest Asia. It is an Indo-European language and has been written for 100 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evolution of Persian can be split into three periods: the Old Iranian period until 100 BC, the Middle Iranian period until 900 AD and the New Iranian period from the 9th Century onwards. During the Old Iranian period, Old Iranian and Avestan were born, but only Old Iranian survived. During the Middle Iranian period, Middle Iranian arose which was grammatically simpler, however it lost significance in the course of Islamisation. Finally, New Iranian (Farsi) evolved from Middle Iranian, Parthian and other dialects, and became the standard language in central and southwest Asia until the 9th Century. Borrowed words from Parthian and Middle Iranian can still be found in New Persian and New Iranian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All texts are translated by experienced specialist translators of Bulgarian into their mother tongues, as per the native speaker principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only Baltic languages still spoken today are Latvian and Lithuanian; Estonian belongs to the Finno-Ugric language family. Due to the relatively similar development of the Baltic countries in the last 65 years, beginning with belonging to the Soviet Union from 1939 to 1990 and finally with entry into the European Union on 1st May 2004, the linguistic backgrounds of these languages have been very similar over this time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Latvian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latvian belongs to the Eastern Baltic languages of the Indo-European language family, and along with Lithuanian and a small minority language is the only actively spoken Baltic language. Today, there are 1.4 million speakers of Latvian in Latvia, amounting to two thirds of the population. Russian, on the other hand, is spoken by roughly 80% of the population because Latvia was part of the Soviet Union from 1939 to 1990, and Russian was therefore the dominant language in the country for the past few decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latvian originated from Latgallian; a regional dialect in the core region of Latgale in the south east of Latvia on the border with Lithuania and Belarus, and still displays similarities to Lithuanian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latvian borrows words from German, Swedish and Russian, as well as increasingly from English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the country’s ascension into the European Union, the significance of Latvian has grown and demand for translations from Latvian into German has risen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lithuanian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Latvian, Lithuanian belongs to the Eastern Baltic languages of the Indo-European language family, but is spoken by more people. There are roughly 3 million native speakers in Lithuania and more than 1 million speakers of Lithuanian living in ethnic groups in Russia, Poland and Belarus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithuanian is split into Highland Lithuanian (Aukštaitija) and Lowland Lithuanian (Samogitian).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latvian and Lithuanian are two closely related languages which have been separate since the 8th Century. Unlike with Latvian, Lithuania has a language commission for the preservation of language purity; one reason why Lithuanian contains far fewer borrowed words than Latvian. Lithuanian has also grown in significance after entering the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Estonian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Estonia belongs to the Baltic States, Estonian is not a Baltic language, belonging instead to the Finno-Ugric family alongside Finnish and Hungarian. Whereas Estonian displays only a few similarities to Hungarian, a native speaker of Estonian would find it easy to understand Finnish due to the two languages’ many shared similarities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Estonia there are three major dialect groups: the southern, northern and the northeastern coast dialect groups. In total, Estonian is spoken by around one million people. Estonia was also part of the Soviet Union until 1990, causing Estonian to be of secondary importance for a long time in its own country. Since gaining independence in 1991, this is no longer the case; currently over 90% of Estonians speak their official language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eisenmann Übersetzungsteam provides technical translations by native speakers of Norwegian into and from Norwegian for all subject areas: economics, law, technology, medicine, advertising, IT etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our subject areas range from finance to law, from technology to advertising, websites, certificates and references.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All texts are translated by experienced specialist translators of Norwegian into their mother tongues (Norwegian or German), as per the native speaker principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Language Variants of Norwegian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norwegian belongs to the North Germanic branch of the Indo-European languages, and together with Swedish, Danish, Icelandic and Faroese it forms the group of Scandinavian languages. Norwegian (“norsk”) is the mother tongue of approx. 5 million people, and is the official language of Norway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two official forms of standardised Norwegian: Bokmål (standard Norwegian) and Nynorsk (“New Norwegian”). The third, unofficial form of Norwegian is called Riksmål. Bokmål is used by 85-90% of the Norwegian population, and linguistically speaking is not a separate language; rather a partially Norwegian-ised version of Danish, and is therefore a daughter language of Danish. However, Nynorsk is closely related to the West Scandinavian languages of Faroese and Icelandic. Additionally, both Bokmål and Nynorsk show elements of Swedish. Norwegians, Danes and Swedes find it relatively easy to communicate with one another; Norwegians can understand the Danes and Swedes much more easily than the Swedes can understand the Danes, because of regional changes. The Norwegians also find it relatively easy to communicate with the Faroese and Icelanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The History of Norwegian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout its history, Norwegian has been influenced by a number of very different dialects due to  Norway’s mountainous topography The development of these dialects and Denmark’s centuries-long domination with Danish as an official language meant that Norway was never able to establish an official language comparable to, for example, standard German. There are two official Norwegian written languages, as stated above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The origins of Norwegian lie in Old Norse, which displays many great similarities to Icelandic. Because Low German was the lingua franca of the Norwegians during the Hanseatic period, numerous words were borrowed from it. Norway’s position of independence was noticeably weakened by the union between Norway and Denmark, and Norway’s resulting governance by Copenhagen (1380-1814) until Norwegian was replaced by Danish in 1450. The Norwegians perceive this period as being under foreign rule by Denmark - Henrik Ibsen even called it the 400.Year Night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the introduction of Danish as the official language, the Norwegian dialects spread across the country continued to be spoken. After the separation of Norway and Denmark, a national Romantic wave developed and with it arose a national movement for the revival of the old Norwegian language. Because by then Danish had been so deeply cemented as an official language, Norwegian was split into two varieties: Riksmål (“standard Norwegian”) and Landsmål (“national language”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until some adjustments were introduced at the beginning of the 20th Century (Dano-Norwegian), Riksmål could more or less be called pure Danish. Landsmål is a language principally developed by the poet and linguist Iyar Aasen in the 1850s from west Norwegian dialects. However, Landsmål is not a planned language because it traces back to closely related, common linguistic roots, rather simply because its natural development to a common language was blocked by external influences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 1929, Riksmål has officially been called Bokmål, and Landsmål is called Nynorsk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 1944, there were always new speakers for Nynorsk due to the growing Norwegian national consciousness, and it was always spoken by at least one third of the Norwegian population. Nowadays, this percentage of Nynorsk speakers has fallen to 10-12%. There are several reasons for this: firstly, Nynorsk is perceived as a strange language in urban areas, particularly in Oslo, because the urban middle classes always refused Nynorsk due to it being based on rural dialects. This rendered Nynorsk unable to establish itself properly in the economic and political centres of Norway. Additionally, many inhabitants of the rural regions, especially of eastern Norway, consider Nynorsk to be somewhat artificial because it is effectively the lowest common denominator of the Norwegian dialects. Finally, the grammar of Nynorsk is more difficult than that of Bokmål, which has rendered the spread of Nynorsk amongst the Norwegian population even more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, most Norwegian dialects are more closely related to Nynorsk than to Bokmål, which has phonological, morphological and other grammatical characteristics which are foreign to Norwegian. In 27% of the Norwegian regions and for 12% of the population, Nynorsk is an official language - in the sparsely populated valleys of the west and the mountainous inland. Norway has officially recognised both language forms (Nynorsk and Bokmål), however the country’s language law prohibits authorities from using one of the two languages more than 75% of the time (although this is often ignored in practice), and queries must be answered in both languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language agreement in the Nordic Council also guarantees that Danish and Swedish are permitted in official correspondence. This agreement counts likewise in Denmark and Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minimum price for a translation is €30, excluding VAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Spread of Italian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Italian language belongs to the Romance branch of the Indo-European languages. Within the Romance languages, Italian belongs to the Eastern Romance group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are roughly 70 million people who are native speakers of Italian, the majority of which live in Italy. Italian is spoken as a second mother tongue, or as a closely related foreign language, by peoples including the Sardinians, the Friulians and the South Tyroleans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the South Tyroleans, the Albanian minority and other groups such as the Slovenians in the lowlands of Monfalcone, Italian is a foreign language in its own country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of Italy, Italian is also an official language in Switzerland, San Marino and Vatican City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the national borders, Italian (or Italian dialects) are spoken in the following regions: the Swiss cantons Ticino and Grissons, Corsica, Istria, Dalmatia (particularly in Split (ancient Spalato) where the older people are mostly still bilingual), the Principality of Monaco (the Monegasques, like the inhabitants of San Remos, speak a language variant which is closer to provincial Italian than to “Florentine” Italian) and Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s Italian language evolved from the Tuscan dialect. Targeted language politics in the 19th Century eventually led to the Florentine dialect being established as the national language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the Romance languages, Italian is closest in pronunciation and vocabulary to Latin. The closest-related major language to Italian is Romanian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Italian Dialects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italian dialects can sometimes differ greatly, often causing their status as dialects to be a subject of controversy among linguists. All Italian dialects have their own history, and can be traced directly back to (Vulgar) Latin. Some, such as Sicilian and Venetic, even have their own literary traditions and are therefore sometimes also described as languages in their own right. Sicilian contains so many similarities in word and script that it could easily be classed as a language closely related to Italian, rather than a dialect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sardinian and Ladin (Dolomites, Friuli) are, unlike Sicilian, recognised by linguists as a language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, these are not the only dialects to have appeared during the Italian language’s long periods of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the north and northwest there are Gallo-Italic dialects including Lombard, Ligurian, Emilian, Bolognese and Piedmontese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These dialects are very closely related to French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dialects of the central and southern regions include Tuscan, Northern Sardinian, Roman and the closely related dialect of Umbria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from Sicilian, south Italian dialects still include Campanian (with the dialects of Abruzzo and Apulia) and Calabrian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, we can say that the great similarity of Italian to Latin makes it easier for a person to learn Italian if they have already mastered either Latin or another modern language such as Spanish or French.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The History of Japanese&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese has a total of around 127 million native speakers, living in Japan as well as in the USA and South America (largely Brazil).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact origins of the Japanese language remain to this day unexplained. Only three indigenous languages of the Japanese islands are known; Japanese, Ainu in Hokkaido and the language of Ryukyo (Okinawa).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linguists are divided on the linguistic classification of Japanese because so far it only has a clear connection to the Ryukyuan language. Both languages – Japanese and Ryukyo – are derived from Proto-Japanese whose nearest ‘relatives’ are Korean languages such as the now-dead Old Koguryo from the north of the peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we assume that during the Jomon period in western Japan an Austronesian language was spoken which was related to the Melanesian and Micronesian island languages. Around the start of the Yayoi period (approx. 300 BC), the technology of rice farming and the use of bronze reached North Kyushu from Korea, and from there spread across the entire western part of Japan. It is probable that the Korean language was brought alongside Korean culture to Japan, whereby it led to a mix between Altaic (Siberian-Turkish) and Austronesian language elements in Korea and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the third or fourth Century, the Japanese came into contact with the already-influential Chinese culture through Korean immigrants. When Japanese monks visited China in the fourth or fifty Century in order to study Buddhism, they introduced Chinese characters and other cultural elements to Japan. As a result, the local Japanese culture mixed, starting with the religious centres, with the Chinese influences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Particularities of Japanese&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that the Japanese character system descends from the Chinese system, the roots of the Japanese language are fully independent. The pronunciation and grammar of both languages are fundamentally different because, unlike Chinese, Japanese is not a tone language and is classed grammatically as an agglutinative language due to its numerous grammatical suffixes, which are similar to the inflection forms, prepositions and conjunctions of European languages. Chinese, however, is classed grammatically as an isolating language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must also be said that the grammar of Japanese – similar to that of Korean – corresponds to Altaic in terms of agglutination and word order, and that the pronunciation – in Japanese, there are no double consonants and few end consonants – descends from Austronesian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In modern Japanese, Chinese and ancient Japanese elements are still clearly distinguishable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the vocabulary of Japanese today, there are borrowed words from several languages. In the 3rd Century, together with the Chinese script, numerous Chinese words were assumed into the Japanese language and their pronunciations were adjusted. These assimilated Chinese words today constitute a large portion of the Japanese vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 16th Century, the beginnings of a short-lived Christian mission in Japan by the Portuguese caused some Portuguese words to be adopted into Japanese, i.e. “pan” (bread) and “tempura” (fried fish and vegetables in batter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Borrowed Words in Japanese&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percentage of words borrowed from the European languages is currently between 10 and 15 per cent, and fluctuates depending on the subject field. Words borrowed from European languages are, however, not written with Chinese characters, rather in the Katakana syllabary, and they are often shortened and changed in pronunciation. The word “pasokon” has thus arisen from the English term “personal computer”. It is also frequently the case that these words’ meanings shift, so that they no longer match their original counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since medical education in Japan followed German lecturers and textbooks between around the middle of the 19th Century until the 20th Century, we find many borrowed words (mostly in the field of medicine) in Japanese from German, i.e. “runge” from “Lunge” and “kuranke” from “Kranke”. However, there are also borrowed German words in philosophy (i.e. “geshutaruto” from “Gestalt”) and mountaineering (i.e. “shutaikuaizen” from “Steigeisen”), as well as terms such as “arubaito” from “Arbeit”, meaning a part-time job in Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the mid-19th Century, most modern Japanese terms related to modern life have been derived from English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Spread of Indonesian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indonesian language is the official and national language of Indonesia. It is spoken as a mother tongue by approximately 160 million people, and is a form of Malay which has been the commercial language of the archipelago for centuries. Both languages are individual languages due mostly to their differences in vocabulary, but also to the influences of different colonial rulers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesian and Malay belong to the Austronesian language family, and are often called the West Malayo-Polynesian languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This language family consists of approximately 700 different languages between Madagascar and the Easter Islands. In the Indonesian archipelago alone there are between 200 and 350 regional languages. The largest of these are Javanese, Sundanese and Madurese Mandouriya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of Indonesia, Indonesian is mainly spoken in Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the Netherlands and the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The History of Indonesian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesian has been shaped by numerous influences over the course of its development; 2000 years ago by Sanskrit, in the 13th Century by Arabic and from the 16th Century onwards by various European languages. At the beginning of the Netherlands’ colonial rule in the 19th Century a number of Dutch terms were adopted into Indonesian, and the Latin alphabet was introduced. After the end of colonial rule, even more words from the regional languages entered into the Indonesian vocabulary, especially from Javanese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main difference between Indonesian and Malay: Malay was exposed to many influences from India and was characterised more by Arabic. From the 14th Century, it was even mostly written in Arabic characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1945, Indonesian officially became the national language of Indonesia. It must be said, however, that Indonesian is actually the second language of the majority of Indonesians, with one of the many regional languages being the mother tongue. In schools, Indonesian was for a long time simply a compulsory subject while all other classes were taught in a regional language. Today, all education in Indonesian schools is carried out in Indonesian, although at home and in everyday life the regional languages are still usually the languages of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Spread of Hindi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 26th January 1965, Hindi has been the official language of India (next to English), and is spoken in most north and central Indian states. Hindi is that which we often call “Indian”, but it in itself is not Indian. Many languages are spoken in India, and Hindi is the most commonly spoken one. Hindi belongs to the Indo-Aryan languages and is derived from the Prakrit languages. Hindi and Urdu are so closely related to one another that together they form the language Hindi-Urdu (also known as Hindustani), understood on the entire Indian subcontinent. However, Hindi-Urdu does not have its own literature, rather it arose originally as a group of dialects of Western Hindi in the upper Doab (tongue/section) of the Ganges and Yamuna, and from the 16th Century until the division of India in 1947 was the lingua franca in all of northern India. Attempts by the British and Ghandi to make Hindi-Urdu an official language failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 600 million speakers, Hindi is one of the most commonly spoken languages in the world after Chinese, Spanish and English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hindi is written in the Devanagari alphabet, but has adopted a great number of expressions from Sanskrit into its vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mauritius and Fiji, a bare majority of the population speaks Hindi. In Guyana and Suriname there live Hindi-speaking ethnic groups, but their numbers are declining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hindi is an umbrella term for the following dialects: Bradj, Bhasha, Bundeli, Janauji, Avadhi, Bagheli and Chattisgarhi. Until the 19th Century, Bradj, Bhasha and Avadhi spawned a rich amount of literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another local dialect of Hindi is Garhwali, spoken in the Garhwali mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the end of the 19th Century, the term ‘Hindi’ has been used to denote the language which developed from the dialect of Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often-used borrowed words in German and English from Hindi include ‘curry’, ‘chutney’, ‘shampoo’ and ‘veranda’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eisenmann Übersetzungsteam provides technical translations by native speakers of Greek into and from Greek for all subject areas: economics, law, technology, medicine, advertising, IT etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our subject areas range from finance to law, from technology to advertising, websites, certificates and references.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All texts are translated by experienced specialist translators of Greek into their mother tongues (Greek or German), as per the native speaker principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Spread of Greek&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek is an Indo-European language and belongs to its own branch of this language family, known as the Hellenic branch. It can be assumed that Greek was once closely related to Ancient Macedonian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are approximately 12 million native speakers of Greek, 9.9 million of which live in Greece, where it is the official language. The remaining native speakers are spread across 35 different countries. Greek is, alongside Turkish, also an official language in Cyprus. It is also accepted as a local official language and a language of education in many regions of South Albania, where a Greek minority group resides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The History of Greek&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The written tradition of Greek began in the 17th Century AD, and is therefore the oldest in the world. The oldest existing records of the language are written in Linear B script, and date back to Mycenaean times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the destruction of the royal courts during the so-called “dark century” (1100-700 BC) and the subsequent loss of Linear B, the Greeks assumed the Phoenician writing system instead, which remains in use today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In classical antiquity, there were numerous Greek dialects. The most important of these were Attic (taught today in schools as ‘Ancient Greek’), Ionic, Doric and North Western, Aeolic and Arcadocypriot Greek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the political, economic and cultural domination of Athens in the 5th Century BC, the Attic Greek dialect spoken there became the supra-regional lingua franca, before becoming a global language and lingua franca under the rule of Alexander the Great in the 4th Century BC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cultural superiority of the East lead to Greek even being retained as an official language alongside Latin in the Roman Empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influence of foreign languages and dialects led to attempts to ‘purify’ the Greek language and to return to classical Attic Greek. A few centuries after the split of the Roman Empire, such a purified form of Greek was declared an official language and language of literature of the Byzantine Empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education in Greek was absolutely forbidden during the occupation by the Ottoman Empire. This led Greek to often be taught at home by priests, and used otherwise in everyday life. Greek was, however, subject to great changes in this age due to lacking education and knowledge of script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founding of modern Greece finally led to the introduction of so-called ‘Katherévousa (Greek for ‘pure language’) as an official language and language of education. This was actually an artificial language which retained the vocabulary of Koiné (oriented on classical Attic Greek) but displayed grammatical structures which had been shaped by New Greek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vernacular (Dimotiki) only became an official language of government and science in 1976, but at the same time many words from Katherévousa were adopted into Dimotiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Particularities of Greek&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Greek language was forced to undergo a myriad of changes in its pronunciation over the course of the millennia, the orthography has remained almost identical due to the enormous efforts to ‘purify’ the language. The accents and symbols for aspirates originating from Hellenic times were used until just recently. The grave accent, the circumflex and the aspirates spiritus asper and spiritus lenis were abolished on 29th April 1982 by presidential decree. Since then, written Greek has only contained the acute accent which indicates the tone of a syllable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the difference between Ancient Greek and New Greek, we can say that the grammar of Ancient Greek displays many similarities to Latin, i.e. participial constructions. When learning Ancient Greek, knowledge of Latin is therefore of advantage. However, it must be added that Ancient Greek contains more structural similarities to German than Latin; for example definite articles in German are very similar, whereas they do not exist at all in Latin. In addition, this similarity with Latin can also occasionally cause confusion because tenses in Greek are often used differently to Latin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grammar of New Greek (Dimotiki) is essentially based on Ancient Greek, however there are three fundamental differences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, New Greek contains no infinitives. These have been replaced by a sentence structure with “na”: “Thelo na pao.” means “I want to go”, or literally “I want that I go”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the dative case in New Greek has been replaced by the preposition “se” with the accusative, or is prefixed by the article “s”, i.e. “sto periboli” means “in the garden”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, New Greek contains no perfect tense; this has been completely replaced by the aorist form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written and spoken Greek has greatly influenced the development of Europe. Most European languages display many Greek origins, and even Latin and Cyrillic originated from a Greek alphabetical basis. The return to Greek - at one time almost forgotten in the West - triggered by the influx of many Byzantines after the fall of Constantinople in 1453 was one of the main sources of the Renaissance and of humanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even today, when scientific/technical terms are created, Greek (and Latin) words are often the preferred choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All texts are translated by experienced specialist translators of Hungarian into their mother tongues (Hungarian or German), as per the native speaker principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Spread of Hungarian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hungarian (‘Magyar nyelv’) is the only non Indo-European language spoken in Central Europe. Together with Finnish, Estonian, Sami and other languages spoken in European Russia and North Siberia, Hungarian belongs to the Finno-Ugric languages. In turn, the Finno-Ugric languages together with the small group of Samoyedic languages form the Uralic language family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hungarian is spoken by approximately 15 million people today, and is the official language of Hungary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The History of Hungarian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first writings in Hungarian date back to the 9th Century, when the Magyars still used Hungarian runic characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with the Khanty and Mansi peoples; two peoples living east of the Ural Mountains, the Hungarians form the Hungarian subgroup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were various approaches in the attempt to prove the origins of Hungarian. This caused Hungarian to often be categorised in the Turkish language group. This theory was underpinned by the fact that both languages are agglutinative and based on vocal harmonies. Even the name “Hungar” is related to the term “Onogur” which was given to Hungary by the Slavs. However, the difference to Hungary’s own designation - Magyar - is striking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 12th Century onwards in Hungary, the legend (Hunor and Magor) spread that the people were descended from the Huns. This, however, is not the case. It is much more logical to assume a common Hungarian migration with the Huns and Goths. Others in this mix of peoples did not take the time to differentiate, and so called all the people Huns. The name ‘Atilla’ (Gothic and Hun origins, meaning “Dad”) remains to this day a highly popular first name for males in Hungary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hungarian language, which contains but a few word similarities to the Indo-European languages, appears at first to be difficult to learn. This has ensured that Hungary, despite being subjected to several foreign rules (i.e. Austria) in the course of its history, has retained a certain cultural autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Hungary’s ascension into the European Union on 1st May 2004, Hungarian has not only been an official language in Hungary but one of the official languages of the EU, causing Hungarian to have grown in importance on a European stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minimum price for a translation is €30, excluding VAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Spread of French&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French language belongs to the Romantic group of Indo-European languages. Currently, it is spoken as a native language by around 77 million people, in for example France, Canada, Belgium and Switzerland. Factor in all the people who speak French as a second language, and we reach around 130 million speakers worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French language is the official language in around 30 countries, including Belgium, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cameroon and the Central African Republic. The wide dissemination of French, even on the African continent, can be traced to the colonial age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The History of French&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roots of French can be found in the 9th Century in Celtic and Latin. The French language has been constantly changing since the Early Middle Ages: it evolved from Old French (9th - 14th Century) into Middle French (14th - 16th Century), and then to New French (16th Century onwards) before becoming the modern language it is today. The French language, which replaced Latin as the language of international communication in the 16th and 17th Centuries – particularly as the language of diplomacy and of the aristocracy, i.e. in Germany - , is still today one of the most significant international languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Particularities of French&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other languages (such as German), only a few terms have been borrowed from English and kept the same spelling and pronunciation. The majority of these borrowed terms were assimilated into the French language system of spelling and pronunciation. Some examples are “boxe” (“boxing”), “bouledogue” (“bulldog”) and “rosbif” (“roast beef”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French is one of the main working languages of organisations such as the United Nations and the European Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These organisations employ a large number of translators and interpreters, and translations to and from French naturally constitute a large portion of the workload for these linguists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the great importance of French, there is great demand for French translations in all subject areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All texts are translated by experienced specialist translators of Finnish into their mother tongues (Finnish or German), as per the native speaker principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Spread of Finnish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finnish is distantly related to Hungarian, and is most closely related to Estonian. Finnish is one of the official languages of Finland (alongside Swedish), with approximately 4.7 million speakers. It is also a minority language in Sweden, Russia and Estonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The History of Finnish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basis for the Finnish language was established in the 16th Century by Mikael Agricola, who based it on Swedish, German and Latin. During the entire period known informally as Old Finland (1540-1820), the written language was based on the western dialects. In the Early New Finnish period (lasting until 1870), the basis for the written language was expanded by the inclusion of the eastern dialects. Through new word formations - mainly by the use of borrowed words - and dialect words, Finnish was enriched and made able to replace Swedish as the official language and the language of education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Particularities of Finnish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orthography of Finnish is almost identical to its phonetics. Tone lies on the first syllable, and the length of vowels and consonants is indicated by double spelling. Further characteristics of Finnish are the vocal harmony and the level change. Finnish also has 15 cases which are formed by attaching certain syllables to the vowel/consonant stem of the substantive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Finnish, there are no definite or indefinite articles, grammatical genders or future tense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated above, Finnish dialects are categorised into a western and an eastern main group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 1st January 1995, Finland was accepted alongside Austria and Sweden as a new member of the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our subject areas range from finance to law, from technology to advertising, websites, certificates and references.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All texts are translated by experienced specialist translators of English into their mother tongues (English or German), as per the native speaker principle. Upon completion, every English translation is then checked by a second specialist translator (the four eye principle). Our mother tongue and four eye principles combined with our many years of experience are your guarantee of a perfect English translation. All translations between English and German are completed in accordance with DIN EN 15038.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wish, we can also certify your English translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;English translations are normally carried out by internal English translators. This lets us react flexibly to translations with very short deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minimum price for a translation is €30, excluding VAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The History of English&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, the Anglo-Saxon language appeared alongside the Low German language after the first sound shift in the West Germanic languages, and was carried to the British Isles from around 450 BC by the Jutes, Angles and Saxons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, English belongs to the West Germanic languages (a subgroup of the Indo-European languages), alongside German and Dutch. Roughly half of the English vocabulary consists of Germanic words (Old English and Scandinavian), and the other half consists of Romantic words (French and Latin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Spread of English&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The English language is not called the universal language for nothing. Together with the most commonly spoken language (Mandarin-Chinese), English is the most widespread language in the world. Great Britain, the USA and Australia are but three examples of countries in which English is the native language. Worldwide, there are now more than 340 million English native speakers; add in those whose second language is English and we reach roughly 510 million speakers worldwide! Additionally, English is the official language in roughly 49 countries, i.e. India, Singapore and Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;English is also the official language - or at least one of them - of most international organisations (i.e. the United Nations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the widespread nature of English, numerous language variants have developed. Nowadays we can’t simply distinguish between British and American English, but also between Australian English, Hong Kong English, Indian English, Canadian English, South African English etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to its spread and its status as a universal language which has certainly been enhanced by 50 years of increasing Americanisation of our society, the English language is of great significance to us translators of English.&lt;/p&gt;

Eisenmann Übersetzungsteam provides technical translations by native speakers of Croatian and Serbian into and from Croatian and Serbian for all subject areas: economics, law, technology, medicine, advertising, IT etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our subject areas range from finance to law, from technology to advertising, websites, certificates and references.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All texts are translated by experienced specialist translators of Croatian and Serbian into their mother tongues (Croatian and Serbian or German), as per the native speaker principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Croatian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Croatian is an official language in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is closely related to Serbian (as well as Bosnian), to the extent that Serbian and Croatian are often merged and referred to as Serbo-Croatian abroad. Worldwide, there are between 5 and 6 million speakers, mainly in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also in southern Italy and Austria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Croatian belongs to the South Slavic languages of the Indo-Germanic language family, and developed alongside Serbian and Bosnian from the Neo-Shtokavian dialect. The Croatian written language dates back to the Chakavian dialect in the 9th Century. In the Middle Ages, Croatian texts were written in the Cyrillic, Glagolitic and Latin alphabets, but from the 16th Century onwards only in Latin. In the Vienna Literary Agreement of 1850, it was agreed that Croatian texts should be written in Latin and Cyrillic and harmonised with one another, which took place around the end of the 19th Century. Today, Croatian texts are written in the Latin alphabet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Kingdom of Yugoslavia from 1918 to 1941, however, national texts were composed in Serbian, not Croatian. In the second Yugoslavian state (Democratic Federal Yugoslavia) the situation improved slightly for Croatian, but both languages only became fully equal in 1991 when Croatian was recognised as an independent language, and the state used the term ‘Serbian and Croatian language’ instead of ‘Serbo-Croatian’. In Croatian, proper nouns are rendered in their original language forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Serbian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serbian is an official language in Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Herzegovina, and is the mother tongue of more than 10 million people. It is categorised in the South Slavic languages of the Indo-Germanic language family. Unlike Croatian, Serbian is mostly written in the Cyrillic alphabet, but is also occasionally written in the Latin one. Proper nouns are normally transcribed. Croatian and Serbian are similar to one another, but not identical. There are differences in their orthography due to their different pronunciations, grammar and vocabularies. Whereas Serbian contains many borrowed words from Medieval Greek (also called Byzantine Greek), Croatian uses some borrowed words from Medieval Latin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eisenmann Übersetzungsteam provides technical translations by native speakers of Danish into and from Danish for all subject areas: economics, law, technology, medicine, advertising, IT etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our subject areas range from finance to law, from technology to advertising, websites, certificates and references.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All texts are translated by experienced specialist translators of Danish into their mother tongues (Danish or German), as per the native speaker principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The History of Danish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danish belongs to the Germanic languages, and together with Swedish, Icelandic, Norwegian and Faroese forms the group of Scandinavian languages. Danish is an official language in Denmark,  the second official language in Greenland and the Faroe Islands, and is the lingua franca in Iceland (formerly a colonial language). In addition, it is protected as a minority language in Schleswig-Holstein by the state constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danish has approximately 5.5 million native speakers in Denmark as well as Germany (in South Schleswig, which was Danish until 1864, in the centre of Flensburg), Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Norway, Sweden, Canada and the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bokmål variant of Norwegian is often termed a Danish dialect by linguists, although it should culturally be a separate language and is perceived thus by its speakers. Danish, Swedish and Norwegian together form the so-called virtual “Interscandinavian language”. This term means that this language does not have an existing written form, and that all three are considered dialects from a linguistic perspective, and are mutually understandable. We must add here that Swedish is not a dialect of Danish, rather both dialects of “Interscandinavian” (continental Scandinavian) should not be confused with the insular Scandinavian spoken on the Faroe Islands and Iceland. For example, native speakers on the Faroe Islands often ask whether you speak Scandinavian, not Danish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danish itself is broken up into many dialects, some of which are only mutually understandable with great difficulty. So-called Radio Københavnsk, that is to say the spoken variant in Danish radio and television, is considered to be the standard language. In recent decades, the dialects have been increasingly suppressed by the spread of this standard language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petuh, spoken in Flensburg, is related to Danish. It is partially based on Danish grammar (sentence structure) and a range of Danish concepts. The origins of Petuh are in the 19th Century: it probably arose when the Danes attempted to learn the German language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Danish West Indies until the 20th Century, there existed so-called Creole Danish. However, it was not passed down in writing and has therefore died out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown above, Danish has left significant traces in Germany, particularly in South Schleswig and Schleswig-Holstein. For example, in South Schleswig there are some Danish schools aimed at the Danish minority living there, but which are also attended by the children of German native speakers. However, in these cases the parents should also speak Danish because, for example, parents’ evenings at these schools are normally held in Danish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most well-known and traditional school, and the only Danish high school in Germany is the Duborg Skolen in Flensburg. Danish is also offered as a third foreign language in a large number of German schools in Flensburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German language contains some words borrowed from Danish; so called Denmark-isms. The most well-known of these is “Lego”; the name of the children’s toy (in Danish it is “leg godt!”, or “play well!”). In South Schleswig, many place and family names have a Danish or Old Scandinavian heritage, for example any places ending in “oder”, “rup” and family names including Jacobsen and Hansen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to German, Faroese and Norwegian have been strongly influenced bv Danish. Its enormous influence on Norway’s Bokmål is due to the 400-year union between Norway and Denmark, which today tends instead to be perceived by Norwegians  as foreign rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the Danish language has been strongly influenced by German, in particular Low German. A large part of the Danish vocabulary consists of borrowed Low German words and translations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also many anglicisms in today’s Danish language. Many Danes greet each other with “Hej” (from “Hi”); a greeting which they borrowed from the Americans after the Second World War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite the diverse range of mutual influences, in particular those between Danish and German, we should not think that Danish is an easy language to learn. Danish is, and remains, a Scandinavian language, and therefore contains many elements foreign to us, i.e. special alphabetical characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All texts are translated by experienced specialist translators of Dutch into their mother tongues (Dutch or German), as per the native speaker principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Categorisation of Dutch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dutch language (Nederlandse taal), also known as Dutch or Hollandish, after the lowland region of Holland, from whose dialect today’s written Dutch developed, belongs to the Germanic branch of the Indo-European languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be said that Dutch was derived from Low Frankonian - a branch of Low German - which  developed in the “lowlands of France” (northwest of the Benrath Line).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indo-European linguistics and German studies classify Dutch as a western branch of Low German, along with Low Saxon and the East Low German branch of the German language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Spread of Dutch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dutch was originally spoken in the Netherlands, the Flemish region of Belgium, Brussels and the French and German regions bordering the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are approximately 25 million native speakers of Dutch, and it is an official language in the Netherlands, Belgium, Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dutch themselves frequently refer to their native language as Hollandish, although that term actually denotes a larger group of dialects. However, modern standard Dutch was greatly influenced by the dialects of the once-strongest federal state of Holland (now the provinces of North and South Holland), whereas beyond Brabant it is difficult to find any traces of the dialects of the other early federal states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Language Variants&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As their native language, many Dutch people speak the Low Saxon (Low German) dialects that are spread across northern Germany, which are indirectly derived from the Old Saxon language. They learn Dutch at school and refer to it as Hollandish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the original German Lower Rhinian, western Ruhr area and Bergische Land dialects are Low Frankonian or Dutch. For example, the South Guelderish dialects are unanimously considered to be Dutch dialects. Until into the 19th Century, Dutch was the working language in most schools in today’s Kleve district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Flemish people in Belgium, however, speak Flemish dialects of Dutch where standard Dutch is an official language in Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The History of Chinese&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese language is a sub-group of the Sino-Tibetan languages, and is the most significant member of this language family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to its wide distribution and its almost three millennia-long history, Chinese has been subjected to so many external influences that there are probably several languages absorbed in it. Chinese is not an individual language, rather it is divided into various “dialects” which differ from one another at least as greatly as the Romance languages. Therefore, most linguists prefer to speak of the “Sinitic languages”. In linguistics, Chinese is now recognised as a group comprised of six languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it would be almost impossible for a speaker of Mandarin Chinese to understand a speaker of, for example, Cantonese. The only possible means of communication is the standard Chinese language P?t?nghu?, and the Chinese script which is used all across China, which can be understood since it is a logographic script independent of pronunciation rules. On a regional level, variations can arise due to the influences of the various “dialects”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Spread&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, there are estimated to be 1.2 billion people who are native speakers of one of the variants of Chinese. Most of these people live in China (the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan) but many also live in Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia. In the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan and Singapore, Chinese is an official language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mandarin Chinese, as it is known (B?if?nghu? = “the language of the north”) is, with 850 million native speakers, by far the most widely spread and commonly spoken variant of Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside Mandarin Chinese there are Gan (20 million speakers), Hakka (30 million speakers), Jinyu (45 million speakers), Min Mei (10 million speakers), Min Nan (40 million speakers), Wu (inc. Shanghainese, ca. 77 million speakers), Xiang (36 million speakers) und Yue (Cantonese, over 80 million speakers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Particularities of Chinese&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese languages belong to the so-called isolating languages; the words do not change based on declination or conjugation, rather stand next to each other as isolated units. Number, case and tense are only expressed in cases of unclear context through added indicatory words. Usage arises from the context, and the indicator is not normally used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While every syllable in classic Chinese is also a morpheme, in modern Chinese many two or three-syllable words may only theoretically be broken up into several morphemes because their long, frequent use in their multi-syllable form have caused them to no longer be found as individual words set together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Chinese languages are tone languages. This means that the tone pitch and its course during pronunciation of the word can change the word’s meaning. The different variants of Chinese have a different number of tones: Mandarin Chinese has 4-5 tones, Wu (Shanghai dialect) has only 2 tones, Cantonese (Yue; spoken in Guangdong and Hong Kong) has 6 tones and Min Nan has 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Chinese script, there are nowadays individual Romance systems for Mandarin Chinese and all other Chinese languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese language has had enormous influence on the development of other Asian languages, in particular Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eisenmann Übersetzungsteam provides technical translations by native speakers of Arabic into and from Arabic for all subject areas: economics, law, technology, medicine, advertising, IT etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our subject areas range from finance to law, from technology to advertising, websites, certificates and references.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All texts are translated by experienced specialist translators of Arabic into their mother tongues (Arabic or German), as per the native speaker principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minimum price for a translation is €50, excluding VAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The History of Arabic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arabic comprises a number of different language forms spoken both today and in the past 1500 years. All of these language forms are brought together into one language, mainly by Islam and in particular by the Koran. The language of the Koran - Classical Arabic - spread from the centre of the Arabian Peninsula - Hijaz - through Islamic conquests across the entire Middle East. In the last ten years of the 6th Century, Kalif Abd al-Malik raised this form of Arabic to the status of official administrative language of the Islamic Empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Spread of Arabic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arabic belongs to the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asian language tree, and is the native language of approx. 250 million people. Arabic is also an official language in the following countries: Arabia, Israel, Yemen, Comoros, Jordan, Qatar, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Mauritania, Oman, the Autonomous Palestinian Territories, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Chad, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arabic is also one of the six official languages of the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dialects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arabic dialects spoken in the various countries differ so greatly that they are often mutually either difficult or impossible to understand. This is the reason why, for example, Algerian films are to some extent subtitled in standard Arabic when screened in the Gulf States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, there are no native speakers of Classical Arabic; it is merely used (with a different vocabulary) as a standard written language in which almost all books and newspapers are written (except in Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria, where French and Arabic have the same status). In the other Arabic countries, English is often used in scientific and technological texts due to Arabic’s lacking vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This modern form of standard Arabic, merely intended for use as a written language, is often spoken on official occasions and on TV and radio. Modern Arabic mainly differs from Classical Arabic in pronunciation and vocabulary, as well as (depending on the speaker’s education) grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether to consider standard Arabic a modern standard language is very controversial. Modern standard Arabic generally lacks a standard vocabulary for a myriad of objects in the modern world, and it also lacks a technical vocabulary for many scientific/technological fields. Additionally, modern standard Arabic is hardly used in the Arabic-speaking countries for spoken communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, spoken standard Arabic has recently become more significant. This development is due in no small part to the TV broadcaster Aljazeera in Qatar, which airs lively discussions between speakers from all parts of the Arabic-speaking world who try to encourage the use of a language similar to standard Arabic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the spoken Cairo dialect of Arabic is generally understandable due to the dominant Egyptian film and TV industry (required by the large Egyptian population). It is also unusual to film entertainment films in standard Arabic because this language tends to be reserved for serious topics, such as TV and radio news and religious programmes and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All texts are translated by experienced specialist translators of Bulgarian into their mother tongues (Bulgarian or German), as per the native speaker principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Spread of Bulgarian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulgarian is an Indo-European language, categorised as an East Slavic language. Bulgarian is currently spoken by 7.3 million people in Bulgaria, and from 1.7 million more people outside of Bulgaria in the Ukraine, Romania, Belarus, Republic of Moldavia and Greece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first records of written Bulgarian date back to the 9th Century AD, and are in the Glagolitic alphabet, which was not retained. Today, Bulgarian is written only in the Cyrillic alphabet. Because writings in other languages were translated into Bulgarian in the past in order to convert them into text form and bring them to other countries, Bulgaria can be seen as the country in which the cornerstone of Slavic Orthodox society was laid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulgarian contains many borrowed words from Turkish which are frequently used in the spoken language, despite governmental attempts at replacing them with borrowed words from Russian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eisenmann Übersetzungsteam was founded in 1990 by Suzanne Eisenmann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suzanne Eisenmann&lt;/strong&gt; is English. After her studies at Southbank University in London (German with Economics and Politics), she worked first as an English teacher (business English) and translator in a language school, then as an editor in an English specialist publishing house two years later. Since 1990, Suzanne Eisenmann has been a German-to-English translator focusing on law (contracts), patent systems, economics and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Georg Eisenmann&lt;/strong&gt; is German. After attending the Gymnasium in Freiburg and completing his military service, he studied Business Administration (Marketing and Exports) at the Pforzheim Academy of Economics. After graduating as a business economist and spending a long time in Britain (London), he worked for two years in product management in medical technology. Also a state-certified and sworn translator, since 1991 Georg Eisenmann has translated from English to German, with a focus on law (contracts), patents, economics, medicine, medical technology and certified translations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Memberships in Professional Associations and Misc.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BDÜ [German Association of Interpreters and Translators] (Suzanne &amp;#x26; Georg Eisenmann)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sworn in at the Regional Court of Karlsruhe (Georg Eisenmann)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accredited as a translator for English at the American Consulate General in Frankfurt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accredited as a translator for English at the British Consulate General in Munich&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Software Used&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Office(Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PageMaker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FrameMaker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;QuarkXPress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dreamweaver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trados&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The BDÜ - The Federal Association of Interpreters and Translators&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suzanne Eisenmann has been a member of the BDÜ since 1991, as a translator of English with a university degree from London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georg Eisenmann has been a member of the BDÜ since 2011, as a state-certified and sworn translator of English at the Regional Court of Karlsruhe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over 7,000 translators and interpreters, the BDÜ is by far the largest association of translators in Germany and one of the largest in the world. The American ATA (American Translators Association) is larger, with 10,000 linguists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BDÜ is organised into state associations, and membership offers a diverse range of benefits alongside seminars for translators. Every two years the BDÜ convention is held in Berlin, at the same time providing translation graduates with a career platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Certified Translations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translations must be certified when used for official purposes, both domestically and abroad. Almost every divorce decree, birth certificate, certificate of registration, partnership agreement or balance sheet which is translated must also be certified by the translator. In the business sphere, a certified translation would be required, for instance, when opening a new branch or taking over a company. In the private sphere, for example, documents necessary for a wedding are officially recognised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By certifying, the sworn and/or publicly appointed translator confirms that the translation is correct with a certification notice, his/her signature and often a stamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When presented abroad, the translator’s certification often must be authenticated by a notary, whose authentication must then be legalised by the regional court. We also offer this service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certified translations in Germany may only be completed by translators who have been appointed, authorised and sworn in accordingly by the respective regional court. A translator may only apply to be sworn in if he/she has passed a state examination as a translator in the language in question, or if he/she has a university-level degree in Translation Studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georg Eisenmann is accredited as a publicly appointed and sworn translator for English and German (Regional Court of Karlsruhe) at the American Consulate General in Frankfurt and the British Consulate General in Munich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with Microsoft Word, we can process your texts in PowerPoint, Excel, Adobe PageMaker and Adobe FrameMaker.

Normal lines of 5…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.app/about/prices/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.app/about/prices/</guid><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Prices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translations are usually (with a few exceptions) priced based on the amount of text translated in normal lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normal lines of 55 keystrokes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A normal line (also known as a standard line) consists of 55 keystrokes. Keystrokes are letters, numbers, commas and also spaces; basically almost every key on the keyboard. When comparing prices, please note that other translators and translation agencies often take a normal line to be 50 keystrokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do normal lines in German match normal lines in French? Not quite. French, Italian and Spanish, for example, are Romance languages, making them more extravagant in their expression than German; therefore they require more space on the page. This means that French translations tend to require between 10 and 15 per cent more space than, for example, English or Dutch translations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A translation is normally used as the basis for calculating the cost. However, exceptions to this rule include, for example, translations into Chinese, Japanese and Korean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our price per line is not graded based on difficulty levels. This makes the process more transparent and avoids disputes. Our price per line is the same for almost all major European languages. Exceptions here are Swedish, Norwegian, Danish and Finnish. For our prices per line, please inquire by e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all types of text are calculated and priced based on the price per line. However, when translating Microsoft Excel charts, PowerPoint presentations, HTML texts or DTP texts (we work with PageMaker or FrameMaker), we do things differently: we usually either create a package price or we calculate the cost based on time spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Package prices are normally used with larger translations or projects involving several different languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Minimum Order Value&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have a minimum order value. Please consider that we have to send e-mails and write up invoices even for small translations. Our minimum order value for most European languages is 30 euro; for Scandinavian languages 40 euro; for Arabic 50 euro and for Asian languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Hindi) 60 euro, all excluding VAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Price Agreements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A framework agreement with a reduced price per line can be agreed in cases involving a contractually defined translation volume.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Quality Translations, 25 Years Experience]]></title><description><![CDATA[Translators of German, English and Other Languages – Translators for German, English, French, Spanish, Italian We are a translation agency…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.app/about/landing/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.app/about/landing/</guid><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Translators of German, English and Other Languages – Translators for German, English, French, Spanish, Italian&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are a translation agency focusing on translations in English and German, as well as French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch and Swedish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Established in 1990 in Pforzheim before relocating to Karlsruhe, we have used our global network of experienced translators to provide translations in all global languages. We use experienced and qualified translators/interpreters for every job, and our work is based on the mother tongue principle, whereby translators always translate into their native language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We specialise in translations from English to German and vice versa. For such translations we almost exclusively use full-time employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;From Law to Medicine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our specialist translators’ chosen subject areas are law (contracts, contract law), patent systems (patent specifications and applications), medicine (in particular medical technology, radiology, urology), economics and finance (balance sheets, correspondence, tender etc.), technology (specifications, instruction manuals and guides, but mainly mechanical engineering, automotive technology, digital technology, pump technology, packaging technology), PR and advertising, IT and websites. Naturally, we also provide certified translations (i.e. contracts, statutes or registration certificates).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Over 25 Years’ Experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past 25 years we have translated for, amongst others, the following well-known companies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daimler/Daimler-Chrysler and Mercedes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deutsche Bahn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ford&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Siemens&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Elmo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ITT, Micronas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Züblin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AEG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1und1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barco&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abas&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Qualifications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mother tongue principle is the rule for all translations. It states that a translator shall only translate into his/her mother tongue. Adhering to this principle ensures that the translation is grammatically and stylistically correct. Only a native speaker has the necessary flair and ability to identify all the subtleties of a language. Here at Eisenmann Übersetzungsteam, we only use native speakers: British and American translators work into English, while German translators always work into German. We never violate this principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only exceptions are a very small number of foreign languages for which no native speakers are available to translate or certify texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all translators obey this principle. Sometimes, German translators work into English, but not in this company! The mistakes which would crop up could possibly slip through the net and have negative consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Contact Us]]></title><description><![CDATA[Legal We look forward to hearing from you, and even more to receiving your translations!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Corona pandemic has occupied centre stage for the past half year, but as summer draws to a close an event with epic implications is looming. The end of 2020 will bring the expiry of the Brexit transition period. On 1 July, the British government had the option of extending the transition period planned to last for 11 months. Boris Johnson however chose not to do so. Since Brexit finally officially occurred on 31 January, as a translation agency so far little has changed for us or generally for other businesses. Politically, Britain has lost its representation at the official EU meetings and is no longer a member of the block’s institutions. Once the transition period lapses at the end of this year, without a deal, World Trade Organization terms will be applied to all trade between the UK and all EU countries, resulting in the application of tariffs and taxes on goods.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Barnier: deal unlikely&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadline of 26 November for agreeing a new trade deal is fast approaching and little progress has been made on coming to any agreement. The recent seventh round of talks on the trade agreement held last week were not very productive according to Michael Barnier, chief negotiator for the EU, who openly voiced his disappointment at the current state of affairs. He rated the chances of a deal being struck between the UK and the EU as unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiating fishing rights has proven to be a fiasco and constitutes a stumbling block on the route to securing a free trade deal. An agreement on fishing is a red line for the EU which basically wants the same access to British waters as there is now whereas the UK insists that ‘British fishing grounds are first and foremost for British boats’. There are of course other problem areas. The British want for UK hauliers to retain the single market benefits but are not prepared to pay or abide by EU rules to attain this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Right to live in Germany&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contingency plans which were scrambled into place in the event of a no deal scenario could may well become a reality. On 31 July, the German Government approved the ‘Brexit Residence Transition Act’ which will enter into force if there is no deal. In line with this new legislation British citizens living in Germany are given a nine month period of grace. During this period, they can retain their rights to live and work in Germany as long as they apply for a residence permit during the nine months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British nationals returning to the UK will be able to bring non-British children, spouses, partners, parents and grandparents with them to apply for settled status before 29 March 2022 irrespective of whether a deal is reached. It remains to be seen if the negotiators can overcome the obstacles preventing the new trade agreement at the next round of negotiations set for 7 September in London. Belgium has now been added to the UK quarantine list but exceptions are to be made for Barnier and his team. In the next few blog entries, the implications of Brexit for specific countries will be examined starting with Germany, Belgium and France.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[New Beginnings]]></title><description><![CDATA[Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and here’s a great quote from this Wikipedia on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg&quot;&gt;salted duck eggs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
