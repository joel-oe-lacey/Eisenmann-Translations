In Asian\nsupermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted\ncharcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,\nwrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the\nsalted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a\nfirm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/Eisenmann-Translations/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/e1596/salty_egg.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Chinese Salty Egg\"\n        title=\"Chinese Salty Egg\"\n        src=\"/Eisenmann-Translations/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/1c72d/salty_egg.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/Eisenmann-Translations/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/a80bd/salty_egg.jpg 148w,\n/Eisenmann-Translations/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/1c91a/salty_egg.jpg 295w,\n/Eisenmann-Translations/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/1c72d/salty_egg.jpg 590w,\n/Eisenmann-Translations/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/a8a14/salty_egg.jpg 885w,\n/Eisenmann-Translations/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/fbd2c/salty_egg.jpg 1180w,\n/Eisenmann-Translations/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/e1596/salty_egg.jpg 2048w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World","type":"blog","category":null,"locale":null,"groupingID":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/new-beginnings/"},"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/joellacey/Contract/Eisenmann-Translations/content/blog/new-beginnings/index.md","html":"<p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and\nConsonantia, there live the blind texts.
