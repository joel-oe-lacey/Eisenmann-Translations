Within the Romance languages, Italian belongs to the Eastern Romance group.</p>\n<p>There are roughly 70 million people who are native speakers of Italian, the majority of which live in Italy. Italian is spoken as a second mother tongue, or as a closely related foreign language, by peoples including the Sardinians, the Friulians and the South Tyroleans.</p>\n<p>For the South Tyroleans, the Albanian minority and other groups such as the Slovenians in the lowlands of Monfalcone, Italian is a foreign language in its own country.</p>\n<p>Outside of Italy, Italian is also an official language in Switzerland, San Marino and Vatican City.</p>\n<p>Beyond the national borders, Italian (or Italian dialects) are spoken in the following regions: the Swiss cantons Ticino and Grissons, Corsica, Istria, Dalmatia (particularly in Split (ancient Spalato) where the older people are mostly still bilingual), the Principality of Monaco (the Monegasques, like the inhabitants of San Remos, speak a language variant which is closer to provincial Italian than to “Florentine” Italian) and Nice.</p>\n<p>Today’s Italian language evolved from the Tuscan dialect. Targeted language politics in the 19th Century eventually led to the Florentine dialect being established as the national language.</p>\n<p>Of all the Romance languages, Italian is closest in pronunciation and vocabulary to Latin. The closest-related major language to Italian is Romanian.</p>\n<h3>Italian Dialects</h3>\n<p>Italian dialects can sometimes differ greatly, often causing their status as dialects to be a subject of controversy among linguists. All Italian dialects have their own history, and can be traced directly back to (Vulgar) Latin. Some, such as Sicilian and Venetic, even have their own literary traditions and are therefore sometimes also described as languages in their own right. Sicilian contains so many similarities in word and script that it could easily be classed as a language closely related to Italian, rather than a dialect.</p>\n<p>Sardinian and Ladin (Dolomites, Friuli) are, unlike Sicilian, recognised by linguists as a language.</p>\n<p>However, these are not the only dialects to have appeared during the Italian language’s long periods of development.</p>\n<p>In the north and northwest there are Gallo-Italic dialects including Lombard, Ligurian, Emilian, Bolognese and Piedmontese.</p>\n<p>These dialects are very closely related to French.</p>\n<p>Dialects of the central and southern regions include Tuscan, Northern Sardinian, Roman and the closely related dialect of Umbria.</p>\n<p>Apart from Sicilian, south Italian dialects still include Campanian (with the dialects of Abruzzo and Apulia) and Calabrian.</p>\n<p>In general, we can say that the great similarity of Italian to Latin makes it easier for a person to learn Italian if they have already mastered either Latin or another modern language such as Spanish or French.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/about/landing\">Home</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Italian","date":null,"description":"About our Italian translations.","category":"Languages"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/lang/itali","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/lang/hungari"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hungarian","type":"pages"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/lang/indonesi"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Indonesian","type":"pages"}},"language":"de","intl":{"language":"de","languages":["en","de"],"messages":{"header":"Eisenmann Übersetzungsteam","contact":"Kontaktiere","cert":"Our translators are certified under the BDÜ"},"routed":true,"originalPath":"/lang/itali","redirect":true,"defaultLanguage":"en"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1254767207","2841359383","3100106777","359013533","412159470"]}
