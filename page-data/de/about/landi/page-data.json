We use experienced and qualified translators/interpreters for every job, and our work is based on the mother tongue principle, whereby translators always translate into their native language.</p>\n<p>We specialise in translations from English to German and vice versa. For such translations we almost exclusively use full-time employees.</p>\n<h3>From Law to Medicine</h3>\n<p>Our specialist translators’ chosen subject areas are law (contracts, contract law), patent systems (patent specifications and applications), medicine (in particular medical technology, radiology, urology), economics and finance (balance sheets, correspondence, tender etc.), technology (specifications, instruction manuals and guides, but mainly mechanical engineering, automotive technology, digital technology, pump technology, packaging technology), PR and advertising, IT and websites. Naturally, we also provide certified translations (i.e. contracts, statutes or registration certificates).</p>\n<h3>Over 25 Years’ Experience</h3>\n<p>Over the past 25 years we have translated for, amongst others, the following well-known companies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Daimler/Daimler-Chrysler and Mercedes</li>\n<li>Deutsche Bahn</li>\n<li>Ford</li>\n<li>Siemens</li>\n<li>Bosch</li>\n<li>British Steel</li>\n<li>Arthur Andersen</li>\n<li>Beiersdorf</li>\n<li>ENBW</li>\n<li>Elmo</li>\n<li>ITT, Micronas</li>\n<li>Züblin</li>\n<li>AEG</li>\n<li>1und1</li>\n<li>Barco</li>\n<li>Abas</li>\n<li>Universität Karlsruhe (KIT), Fachhochschule Pforzheim, Fachhochschule Karlsruhe</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Qualifications</h3>\n<p>Our translators are either qualified to degree level, state certified or state recognised. Engineers, doctors and lawyers also translate for us in various subject areas (technology, medicine or law).</p>\n<h3>Languages</h3>\n<p>We work in almost all languages, but mainly English, German, French, Spanish and other European languages. Our translations from English to German and vice versa - completed on site - are subject to our four eye principle: our English translator produces the translation and another experienced translator checks it for errors.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quality Translations, 25 Years Experience","date":null,"description":"About the Eisenmann Übersetzungsteam team.","category":"Landing"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/about/landi","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/about/jo"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Jobs","type":"pages"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/about/jobs/germ"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Jobs","type":"pages"}},"language":"de","intl":{"language":"de","languages":["en","de"],"messages":{"header":"Eisenmann Übersetzungsteam","contact":"Kontaktiere","cert":"Our translators are certified under the BDÜ"},"routed":true,"originalPath":"/about/landi","redirect":true,"defaultLanguage":"en"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1254767207","2841359383","3100106777","359013533","412159470"]}
