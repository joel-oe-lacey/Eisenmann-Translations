Worldwide, there are between 5 and 6 million speakers, mainly in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also in southern Italy and Austria.</p>\n<p>Croatian belongs to the South Slavic languages of the Indo-Germanic language family, and developed alongside Serbian and Bosnian from the Neo-Shtokavian dialect. The Croatian written language dates back to the Chakavian dialect in the 9th Century. In the Middle Ages, Croatian texts were written in the Cyrillic, Glagolitic and Latin alphabets, but from the 16th Century onwards only in Latin. In the Vienna Literary Agreement of 1850, it was agreed that Croatian texts should be written in Latin and Cyrillic and harmonised with one another, which took place around the end of the 19th Century. Today, Croatian texts are written in the Latin alphabet.</p>\n<p>During the Kingdom of Yugoslavia from 1918 to 1941, however, national texts were composed in Serbian, not Croatian. In the second Yugoslavian state (Democratic Federal Yugoslavia) the situation improved slightly for Croatian, but both languages only became fully equal in 1991 when Croatian was recognised as an independent language, and the state used the term ‘Serbian and Croatian language’ instead of ‘Serbo-Croatian’. In Croatian, proper nouns are rendered in their original language forms.</p>\n<h3>Serbian</h3>\n<p>Serbian is an official language in Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Herzegovina, and is the mother tongue of more than 10 million people. It is categorised in the South Slavic languages of the Indo-Germanic language family. Unlike Croatian, Serbian is mostly written in the Cyrillic alphabet, but is also occasionally written in the Latin one. Proper nouns are normally transcribed. Croatian and Serbian are similar to one another, but not identical. There are differences in their orthography due to their different pronunciations, grammar and vocabularies. Whereas Serbian contains many borrowed words from Medieval Greek (also called Byzantine Greek), Croatian uses some borrowed words from Medieval Latin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/about/landing\">Home</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Croatian and Serbian","date":null,"description":"About our Croatian and Serbian translations.","category":"Languages"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/languages/croatian-and-serbian/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/languages/kroatisch-und-serbisch/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Kroatisch und Serbisch","type":"pages"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/languages/dänisch/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Dänisch","type":"pages"}},"language":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","de"],"messages":{"header":"Eisenmann Translations","contact":"Contact","cert":"Our translators are certified under the BDÜ"},"routed":false,"originalPath":"/languages/croatian-and-serbian/","redirect":true,"defaultLanguage":"en"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1254767207","2841359383","3100106777","359013533","412159470"]}
