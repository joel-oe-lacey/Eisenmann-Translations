Finnish is one of the official languages of Finland (alongside Swedish), with approximately 4.7 million speakers. It is also a minority language in Sweden, Russia and Estonia.</p>\n<h3>The History of Finnish</h3>\n<p>The basis for the Finnish language was established in the 16th Century by Mikael Agricola, who based it on Swedish, German and Latin. During the entire period known informally as Old Finland (1540-1820), the written language was based on the western dialects. In the Early New Finnish period (lasting until 1870), the basis for the written language was expanded by the inclusion of the eastern dialects. Through new word formations - mainly by the use of borrowed words - and dialect words, Finnish was enriched and made able to replace Swedish as the official language and the language of education.</p>\n<h3>Particularities of Finnish</h3>\n<p>The orthography of Finnish is almost identical to its phonetics. Tone lies on the first syllable, and the length of vowels and consonants is indicated by double spelling. Further characteristics of Finnish are the vocal harmony and the level change. Finnish also has 15 cases which are formed by attaching certain syllables to the vowel/consonant stem of the substantive.</p>\n<p>In Finnish, there are no definite or indefinite articles, grammatical genders or future tense.</p>\n<p>As stated above, Finnish dialects are categorised into a western and an eastern main group.</p>\n<p>On 1st January 1995, Finland was accepted alongside Austria and Sweden as a new member of the European Union.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/about/landing\">Home</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Finnish","date":null,"description":"About our Finnish translations.","category":"Languages"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/languages/finnish/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/languages/finnisch/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Finnisch","type":"pages"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/languages/französisch/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Französisch","type":"pages"}},"language":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","de"],"messages":{"header":"Eisenmann Translations","contact":"Contact","cert":"Our translators are certified under the BDÜ"},"routed":false,"originalPath":"/languages/finnish/","redirect":true,"defaultLanguage":"en"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1254767207","2841359383","3100106777","359013533","412159470"]}
