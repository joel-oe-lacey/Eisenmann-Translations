Approximately 2 million people speak Slovenian as a mother tongue, the majority of whom live in Slovenia. However, there are also minorities in Northeast Italy, Western Hungary and Croatia, as well as in Carinthia.</p>\n<p>Slovenian was born from Proto-Slavic which evolved before the 9th Century. From this Proto-Slavic, Old Slavic appeared in the 9th Century and was almost exclusively used as a written language, and which was the basis for the Church Slavonic developed from the 11th Century onwards.</p>\n<p>From the 13th Century onwards, Slovenia fell under the rule of the House of Habsburg, and in 1867 it became a part of the multinational state of Austria-Hungary. Due to the dominance of the House of Habsburg, Slovenian became the dominant language and German became the language of administration and science. At the beginning of the 20th Century, a national movement began which endeavoured to de-Germanise the language, and to find Slovenian equivalents for German terms. In 1918, Slovenia became part of the Kingdom of Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia, and it was endeavoured to create a common written language. In order to preserve the Slovenian language, a language academy was founded.</p>\n<p>Today, Slovenian is an independent language encompassing 7 dialects spoken by the various minorities in Italy, Carinthia and Hungary.</p>\n<p>As of 1st May 2004, Slovenian has been an official language of the European Union.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/Eisenmann-Translations/about/landing\">Home</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Slovenian","category":"Languages","locale":"en"},"fields":{"slug":"/lang/slovenian/"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/lang/slovenian/german/","groupingID":32,"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/lang/spanish/"},"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/joellacey/Contract/Eisenmann-Translations/content/pages/lang/spanish/index.md","html":"<h2>Spanish</h2>\n<p>Language combinations for translations involving Spanish:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spanish to German</li>\n<li>German to Spanish</li>\n<li>English to Spanish</li>\n<li>Spanish to English</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Eisenmann Übersetzungsteam provides technical translations by native speakers of Spanish into and from Spanish for all subject areas: economics, law, technology, medicine, advertising, IT etc.</p>\n<p>Our subject areas range from finance to law, from technology to advertising, websites, certificates and references.</p>\n<p>All texts are translated by experienced specialist translators of Spanish into their mother tongues (Spanish or German), as per the native speaker principle.

It is often categorised together with Catalan and Portuguese as an Ibero-Romance language.</p>\n<p>Written Spanish was characterised mainly by the use of language in the central Spanish region of Castile, and in order to keep the language separate from the other language variants spoken in Spain, in particular Galician and Catalan, High Spanish was termed the Castilian language.</p>\n<p>Latin letters are used in Spanish, yet the modern language also features acute accents for pronunciation purposes, and uses the letters ñ and ü.</p>\n<p>Worldwide there are around 360 million people whose mother tongue is Spanish, living in (for example) Spain, Mexico, Columbia, Argentina, Nicaragua, Chile, the USA, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Cuba and Peru. Add to this the people who speak Spanish as a second language and we get roughly 420 million speakers worldwide. Spanish is an official language in the following countries: Equatorial Guinea, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Cuba, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Equador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Columbia, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela and the USA. It is also an official language in the European and African Unions, as well as in the United Nations.</p>\n<p>Consequently, Spanish is the fourth most-commonly spoken language in the world after Mandarin Chinese, Hindi and English.</p>\n<h3>The History of Spanish</h3>\n<p>When we consider the historical development of Spanish, we can say that it has been characterised by numerous influences.</p>\n<p>The earliest inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula (to our knowledge) were the Iberians; a people of African origins. In around 600 BC, the Celts crossed the Pyrenees and mixed with the Iberians to form the so-called Celtiberians. Basque, spoken by around 850,000 people in the Bay of Biscay on both sides of the Franco-Spanish border, is the only linguistic remnant of that age, termed the Pre-Roman Era.</p>\n<p>From the 3rd Century onwards, the Romans began the conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, and until the Gothic invasion in 414 people across the entire Iberian Peninsula spoke local variations. Although the Goths controlled Spain for over 300 years, they had relatively little influence on the language and on social life. There are, therefore, only a few words of German origins to be found in Spanish today.</p>\n<p>The conquest of Spain by the Arabs, who in 711 began an expansion out of Africa to the east and north of the peninsula, brought with it a deep-reaching and permanent influence on the Spanish language. For several centuries the Arabs ruled all of Spain, and when the reconquest of Spain was brought to a close in 1492 with the fall of Granada, many Arabic elements had already seeped into Spanish. Borrowed Arabic words include “aceite” (“oil”) and “aceituna” (“olive”).</p>\n<p>The reforms introduced by Ferdinand III (1217-1252) and Alfonso X (1252-1282) were of great linguistic significance. These reforms abolished Latin as the language of documents and replaced it with Castilian. After the union of the Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon in 1479, Castilian became the national language of the Kingdom of Spain.</p>\n<h3>Language Variants of Spanish</h3>\n<p>One variant of Spanish is Judaeo-Spanish, or Ladino. This was the language spoken by the Sephardim; Jews expelled from Spain in 1492. They now live in Greece, Turkey, Israel, North Morocco and the USA.</p>\n<p>Today, we have to distinguish between the Spanish spoken on the Iberian Peninsula and Argentinean Spanish, American Spanish, Spanglish and the variation of American Spanish spoken in the Spanish-speaking countries of Middle and South America.</p>\n<p>Through its wide dissemination as the fourth most-commonly spoken language in the world, Spanish is not just one of the main working languages of all European and international organisations such as the European Parliament and the United Nations, but also one of the most-commonly translated and interpreted languages in the world.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/Eisenmann-Translations/about/landing\">Home</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Spanish","type":"pages","category":"Languages","locale":"en","groupingID":33}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/lang/turkish/"},"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/joellacey/Contract/Eisenmann-Translations/content/pages/lang/turkish/index.md","html":"<h2>Turkish</h2>\n<p>Language combinations for translations involving Turkish:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turkish to German</li>\n<li>German to Turkish</li>\n<li>English to Turkish</li>\n<li>Turkish to English</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Eisenmann Übersetzungsteam provides technical translations by native speakers of Turkish into and from Turkish for all subject areas: economics, law, technology, medicine, advertising, IT etc.</p>\n<p>Our subject areas range from finance to law, from technology to advertising, websites, certificates and references.</p>\n<p>All texts are translated by experienced specialist translators of Turkish into their mother tongues (Turkish or German), as per the native speaker principle.</p>\n<h3>The Spread of Turkish</h3>\n<p>Turkish belongs to the Turkic languages, and is an official language in Turkey and Cyprus. Modern Turkish is the mother tongue of approximately 65 million people in Turkey and 15 million Turks living mainly in Bulgaria, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Greece, Belgium, Austria, Romania or Germany.</p>\n<p>Turkish is an agglutinative language, and therefore differs from the Indo-European languages. Agglutinative languages indicate all grammatical forms through one (unambiguous) ending. This means that several endings can follow one another, establishing a sequence. Just as with Finnish, Turkish contains no grammatical genders. Turkish also contains no definite articles and five cases.</p>\n<h3>The History of Turkish</h3>\n<p>Modern Turkish belongs to the South Turkic language group, and traces directly back to the Oghuz language; the language of the eastern Turk tribes.</p>\n<p>Over the centuries, Turkish has been subjected to strong influences from Persian and Arabic; at one point almost 20% of the Turkish vocabulary consisted of words of Persian or Arabic origins.</p>\n<p>After the founding of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, the Turks began to replace the borrowed words in Turkish. This process is still not complete, so some words of Persian or Arabic origins are still used in Turkish today. Over the course of the 20th Century, Turkish absorbed many words from European languages, in particular from French.</p>\n<p>After the Islamisation of the Oghuz people, the written Arabic language was adopted and expanded with Persian characters. This alphabet was, however, not suited for the Turkish language.</p>\n<p>Since 1928, Turkish has been written in a variation of the Latin alphabet, developed by Kemal Atatürk himself. He named this new writing system the new Turkish alphabet. Therefore, the current Turkish alphabet is comprised of 29 letters, whereby each letter is assigned to a sound.</p>\n<p>The Istanbul dialect formed the basis for the new way of writing the words and for the general language reform. There are many Turkish dialects, and the Istanbul dialect counts as the standard language. Other Turkish dialects include the Black Sea dialect, the Agaean dialect and the dialect spoken in the east of Turkey.</p>\n<p>Turkish is most closely related to Azerbaijani and Turkmen. The Balkan-Turkish dialect Gagauz in today’s Republic of Moldavia is also a relative of Turkish.</p>\n<p>The “Türk Dil Kurumu”, or the Turkish Language Association, is a national facility opened on 12th July 1932 under Kemal Atatürk. Its task is to restructure, modernise and standardise the Turkish language. To this end, words borrowed from Persian, Arabic and other languages are replaced by new Turkish creations. These new terms are then called “Öztürkçe“ (‘proper Turkish’) and disseminated through dictionaries and the media.</p>\n<p>The Turkish Language Association also operates an active language policy; also an expression of the position of the dominant politics and speakers. This means that significant conclusions may be drawn regarding a speaker’s political stance based on either his/her acceptance and use of newly-created terms or retention of older words in communication.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/Eisenmann-Translations/about/landing\">Home</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Turkish","type":"pages","category":"Languages","locale":"en","groupingID":35}},"language":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","de"],"messages":{"header":"Eisenmann Translations","contact":"Contact","cert":"Our translators are certified under the BDÜ","gatsby":"Built with"},"routed":false,"originalPath":"/lang/slovenian/german/","redirect":true,"defaultLanguage":"en"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1466983126","2841359383","3300109160","359013533","412159470"]}
