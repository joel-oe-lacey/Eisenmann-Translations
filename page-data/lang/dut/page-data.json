However, modern standard Dutch was greatly influenced by the dialects of the once-strongest federal state of Holland (now the provinces of North and South Holland), whereas beyond Brabant it is difficult to find any traces of the dialects of the other early federal states.</p>\n<h3>Language Variants</h3>\n<p>As their native language, many Dutch people speak the Low Saxon (Low German) dialects that are spread across northern Germany, which are indirectly derived from the Old Saxon language. They learn Dutch at school and refer to it as Hollandish.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the original German Lower Rhinian, western Ruhr area and Bergische Land dialects are Low Frankonian or Dutch. For example, the South Guelderish dialects are unanimously considered to be Dutch dialects. Until into the 19th Century, Dutch was the working language in most schools in today’s Kleve district.</p>\n<p>The Flemish people in Belgium, however, speak Flemish dialects of Dutch where standard Dutch is an official language in Belgium.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/about/landing\">Home</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Dutch","date":null,"description":"About our Dutch translations.","category":"Languages"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/lang/dut","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/lang/dutch/germ"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Deutsch","type":"pages"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/lang/english/germ"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Englisch","type":"pages"}},"language":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","de"],"messages":{"header":"Eisenmann Translations","contact":"Contact","cert":"Our translators are certified under the BDÜ"},"routed":false,"originalPath":"/lang/dut","redirect":true,"defaultLanguage":"en"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1254767207","2841359383","3100106777","359013533","412159470"]}
