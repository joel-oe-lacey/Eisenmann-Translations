Hindi is that which we often call “Indian”, but it in itself is not Indian. Many languages are spoken in India, and Hindi is the most commonly spoken one. Hindi belongs to the Indo-Aryan languages and is derived from the Prakrit languages. Hindi and Urdu are so closely related to one another that together they form the language Hindi-Urdu (also known as Hindustani), understood on the entire Indian subcontinent. However, Hindi-Urdu does not have its own literature, rather it arose originally as a group of dialects of Western Hindi in the upper Doab (tongue/section) of the Ganges and Yamuna, and from the 16th Century until the division of India in 1947 was the lingua franca in all of northern India. Attempts by the British and Ghandi to make Hindi-Urdu an official language failed.</p>\n<p>With 600 million speakers, Hindi is one of the most commonly spoken languages in the world after Chinese, Spanish and English.</p>\n<p>Hindi is written in the Devanagari alphabet, but has adopted a great number of expressions from Sanskrit into its vocabulary.</p>\n<p>In Mauritius and Fiji, a bare majority of the population speaks Hindi. In Guyana and Suriname there live Hindi-speaking ethnic groups, but their numbers are declining.</p>\n<p>Hindi is an umbrella term for the following dialects: Bradj, Bhasha, Bundeli, Janauji, Avadhi, Bagheli and Chattisgarhi. Until the 19th Century, Bradj, Bhasha and Avadhi spawned a rich amount of literature.</p>\n<p>Another local dialect of Hindi is Garhwali, spoken in the Garhwali mountains.</p>\n<p>Since the end of the 19th Century, the term ‘Hindi’ has been used to denote the language which developed from the dialect of Delhi.</p>\n<p>Often-used borrowed words in German and English from Hindi include ‘curry’, ‘chutney’, ‘shampoo’ and ‘veranda’.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/about/landing\">Home</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hindi","date":null,"description":"About our Hindi translations.","category":"Languages"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/languages/hindi/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/languages/hungarian/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hungarian","type":"pages"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/languages/indonesisch/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Indonesisch","type":"pages"}},"language":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","de"],"messages":{"header":"Eisenmann Translations","contact":"Contact","cert":"Our translators are certified under the BDÜ"},"routed":true,"originalPath":"/languages/hindi/","redirect":true,"defaultLanguage":"en"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1254767207","2841359383","3100106777","359013533","412159470"]}
