Roughly half of the English vocabulary consists of Germanic words (Old English and Scandinavian), and the other half consists of Romantic words (French and Latin).</p>\n<h3>The Spread of English</h3>\n<p>The English language is not called the universal language for nothing. Together with the most commonly spoken language (Mandarin-Chinese), English is the most widespread language in the world. Great Britain, the USA and Australia are but three examples of countries in which English is the native language. Worldwide, there are now more than 340 million English native speakers; add in those whose second language is English and we reach roughly 510 million speakers worldwide! Additionally, English is the official language in roughly 49 countries, i.e. India, Singapore and Nigeria.</p>\n<p>English is also the official language - or at least one of them - of most international organisations (i.e. the United Nations).</p>\n<p>Due to the widespread nature of English, numerous language variants have developed. Nowadays we can’t simply distinguish between British and American English, but also between Australian English, Hong Kong English, Indian English, Canadian English, South African English etc.</p>\n<p>Thanks to its spread and its status as a universal language which has certainly been enhanced by 50 years of increasing Americanisation of our society, the English language is of great significance to us translators of English.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/about/landing\">Home</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"English","date":null,"description":"About our English translations.","category":"Languages"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/languages/english/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/languages/englisch/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Englisch","type":"pages"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/languages/finnisch/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Finnisch","type":"pages"}},"language":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","de"],"messages":{"header":"Eisenmann Translations","contact":"Contact","cert":"Our translators are certified under the BDÜ"},"routed":true,"originalPath":"/languages/english/","redirect":true,"defaultLanguage":"en"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1254767207","2841359383","3100106777","359013533","412159470"]}
