An additional 16 million native speakers live in over 25 countries including Russia, Poland, Slovakia, the USA, Canada and Belarus.</p>\n<p>Ukrainian, like Russian, belongs to the East Slavic languages and evolved in the 9th Century from Proto-Slavic in the region of Kievan Rus’. Because ‘Russian’ is mistakenly assumed from ‘Rus’, Russian was named Great Russian and Ukrainian was named Lesser Russian. In the 18th Century, an independent Ukrainian written and literature language finally emerged. Around the end of the 19th Century and later in the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian language stood below Russian in importance. Ukrainian was still spoken, but it was not the lingua franca. Even today, the Russian influence on the language variants of Ukrainian is still visibly apparent.</p>\n<p>Ukrainian has been the official language of the Ukraine since 1991.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/about/landing\">Home</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ukrainian","date":null,"description":"About our Ukrainian translations.","category":"Languages"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/languages/ukrainian/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/languages/ukrainisch/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ukrainisch","type":"pages"}},"next":null,"language":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","de"],"messages":{"header":"Eisenmann Translations","contact":"Contact","cert":"Our translators are certified under the BDÜ"},"routed":true,"originalPath":"/languages/ukrainian/","redirect":true,"defaultLanguage":"en"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1254767207","2841359383","3100106777","359013533","412159470"]}
