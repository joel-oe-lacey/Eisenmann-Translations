In Finland, which until 1809 belonged to Sweden, Swedish is one of the two official languages, and today approximately 300,000 native speakers of Swedish (6% of the population) live there - around 25,000 of these live on the exclusively Swedish-speaking Aland Islands. In Aland and Finland, Swedish is an official language, and in Finland it is even taught as a compulsory subject at school. Curiously, Swedish is not legally an official language in Sweden.</p>\n<h3>Particularities of Swedish</h3>\n<p>The pronunciation of Swedish is known for its distinctive system of vocals, whereby longer and shorter vocals change the meanings of words.</p>\n<p>Unlike German and English which only have a stress accent, words in Swedish are either spoken with a stress accent or with a musical/melodious accent. As in Norwegian, this accent can change the meanings of words. There are also regional differences.</p>\n<p>The only existent case in Swedish is the genitive, even though traces of the accusative (used in the past) can still be found. The genitive is formed by adding an ‘s’ suffix which is not added if the substantive already ends with an ‘s’. The substantive follows after the genitive, always in the indeterminate form.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/about/landing\">Home</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Swedish","date":null,"description":"About our Swedish translations.","category":"Languages"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/lang/swedi","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/lang/spani"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Spanish","type":"pages"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/lang/slovak/germ"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Slowakisch","type":"pages"}},"language":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","de"],"messages":{"header":"Eisenmann Translations","contact":"Contact","cert":"Our translators are certified under the BDÜ"},"routed":true,"originalPath":"/lang/swedi","redirect":true,"defaultLanguage":"en"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1254767207","2841359383","3100106777","359013533","412159470"]}
