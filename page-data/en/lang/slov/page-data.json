There are approximately 5 million native speakers of Slovak in Slovakia, in addition to approximately one million emigrants in Canada and the USA, as well as minorities in the Ukraine, Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary and Romania.</p>\n<p>Slovak developed from the Slovene language in the 10th Century. Because the region of Slovakia belonged to the Kingdom of Hungary in the 10th Century, Latin, German and Hungarian became the major languages for administration and business.

At around the end of the 19th Century, Slovak was eventually codified, giving rise to the use of a simple written language.</p>\n<p>Due to its history and the country’s former inclusion in the Kingdom of Hungary, Slovak contains a range of words borrowed from Czech, German, Latin and other European languages.</p>\n<p>When Slovakia joined the European Union on 1st May 2004, the importance of Slovak grew.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/about/landing\">Home</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Slovak","date":null,"description":"About our Slovak translations.","category":"Languages"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/lang/slov","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/lang/russi"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Russian","type":"pages"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/lang/spani"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Spanish","type":"pages"}},"language":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","de"],"messages":{"header":"Eisenmann Translations","contact":"Contact","cert":"Our translators are certified under the BDÜ"},"routed":true,"originalPath":"/lang/slov","redirect":true,"defaultLanguage":"en"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1254767207","2841359383","3100106777","359013533","412159470"]}
