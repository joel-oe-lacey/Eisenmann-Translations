Due to the relatively similar development of the Baltic countries in the last 65 years, beginning with belonging to the Soviet Union from 1939 to 1990 and finally with entry into the European Union on 1st May 2004, the linguistic backgrounds of these languages have been very similar over this time period.</p>\n<h3>Latvian</h3>\n<p>Latvian belongs to the Eastern Baltic languages of the Indo-European language family, and along with Lithuanian and a small minority language is the only actively spoken Baltic language. Today, there are 1.4 million speakers of Latvian in Latvia, amounting to two thirds of the population. Russian, on the other hand, is spoken by roughly 80% of the population because Latvia was part of the Soviet Union from 1939 to 1990, and Russian was therefore the dominant language in the country for the past few decades.</p>\n<p>Latvian originated from Latgallian; a regional dialect in the core region of Latgale in the south east of Latvia on the border with Lithuania and Belarus, and still displays similarities to Lithuanian.</p>\n<p>Latvian borrows words from German, Swedish and Russian, as well as increasingly from English.</p>\n<p>Since the country’s ascension into the European Union, the significance of Latvian has grown and demand for translations from Latvian into German has risen.</p>\n<h3>Lithuanian</h3>\n<p>Like Latvian, Lithuanian belongs to the Eastern Baltic languages of the Indo-European language family, but is spoken by more people. There are roughly 3 million native speakers in Lithuania and more than 1 million speakers of Lithuanian living in ethnic groups in Russia, Poland and Belarus.</p>\n<p>Lithuanian is split into Highland Lithuanian (Aukštaitija) and Lowland Lithuanian (Samogitian).</p>\n<p>Latvian and Lithuanian are two closely related languages which have been separate since the 8th Century. Unlike with Latvian, Lithuania has a language commission for the preservation of language purity; one reason why Lithuanian contains far fewer borrowed words than Latvian. Lithuanian has also grown in significance after entering the European Union.</p>\n<h3>Estonian</h3>\n<p>Although Estonia belongs to the Baltic States, Estonian is not a Baltic language, belonging instead to the Finno-Ugric family alongside Finnish and Hungarian. Whereas Estonian displays only a few similarities to Hungarian, a native speaker of Estonian would find it easy to understand Finnish due to the two languages’ many shared similarities.</p>\n<p>In Estonia there are three major dialect groups: the southern, northern and the northeastern coast dialect groups. In total, Estonian is spoken by around one million people. Estonia was also part of the Soviet Union until 1990, causing Estonian to be of secondary importance for a long time in its own country. Since gaining independence in 1991, this is no longer the case; currently over 90% of Estonians speak their official language.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/Eisenmann-Translations/about/landing\">Home</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Latvian, Lithuanian, Estonian","category":"Languages","locale":"en"},"fields":{"slug":"/lang/latvian lithuanian estonian/"}}},{"node":{"html":"<h2>Lettisch, Litauisch, Estnisch</h2>\n<p>Für diese drei Sprachen sind Übersetzungen ins Deutsche und Englische möglich.</p>\n<p>Eisenmann Übersetzungsteam bietet seit 1990 Fachübersetzungen in Lettisch, Litauisch und Estnisch durch erfahrene Übersetzer für folgende Gebiete an: Recht (Verträge), Urkunden, Technik, Medizin und Wirtscahft.</p>\n<p>Sämtliche Texte werden durch erfahrene, fachkundige Übersetzer fast ausnahmslos in die jeweils eigene Muttersprache übersetzt.</p>\n<p>Die einzigen heute noch gesprochenen baltischen Sprachen sind Lettisch und Litauisch, Estnisch dagegen gehört zur finno-ugrischen Sprachfamilie.

Mai 2004, ähneln sich auch die sprachgeschichtlichen Hintergründe für die einzelnen Sprachen für diesen Zeitraum.</p>\n<h3>Lettisch - eine für Übersetzer nicht unwichtige Sprache</h3>\n<p>Lettisch gehört zu den ostbaltischen Sprachen der indo-europäischen Sprachfamilie und ist neben Litauisch und einer kleinen Minderheitensprache die einzige aktiv gesprochene baltische Sprache. Heutzutage gibt es 1,4 Millionen Lettisch Muttersprachler in Lettland, was ungefähr zwei Drittel der Bevölkerung sind. Russisch hingegen wird von gut 80 % der Bevölkerung beherrscht, da Lettland von 1939 bis 1990 Teil der Sowjetunion war und Russisch somit in den letzten Jahrzehnten die dominante Sprache im Land war.</p>\n<p>Das Lettische entstand aus dem Lettgallischen, dem regionalen Dialekt in der Kernregion Lettgallen im Südosten Lettlands an der Grenze zu Litauen und Weißrussland und weist immer noch Ähnlichkeiten zur litauischen Sprache auf.</p>\n<p>Das Lettische nimmt gerade aus dem Deutschen, Schwedischen, Russischen und jetzt verstärkt aus dem Englischen Lehnwörter in die eigene Sprache auf.</p>\n<p>Seit dem Beitritt zur Europäischen Union ist die Bedeutung der lettischen Sprache gewachsen, der Bedarf an Übersetzungen aus dem Lettischen ins Deutsche gestiegen.</p>\n<h3>Litauisch - für Litauisch-Übersetzungen</h3>\n<p>Ebenso wie Lettisch gehört auch Litauisch zu den ostbaltischen Sprachen der indo-europäischen Sprachfamilie, wird allerdings von mehr Menschen gesprochen. Es gibt knapp drei Millionen Muttersprachler in Litauen, dazu kommen mehr als eine Million Menschen, die Litauisch sprechen und als Minderheit in Russland, Polen und Weißrussland leben.</p>\n<p>Litauisch spaltet sich auf in das Niederlitauische und das Oberlitauische</p>\n<p>Lettisch und Litauisch sind zwei miteinander sehr verwandte Sprachen, die sich ab dem 8. Jahrhundert voneinander abgegrenzt haben. Anders als beim Lettischen gibt es in Litauen eine Sprachkommission zur Wahrung der Sprachreinheit, ein Grund unter anderem, warum das Litauische weitaus weniger Lehnwörter kennt als das Lettische. Auch die litauische Sprache hat im Rahmen der Zugehörigkeit zur Europäischen Union an Bedeutung gewonnen.</p>\n<h3>Estnisch - estnische Übersetzungen aus Karlsruhe</h3>\n<p>Obwohl Estland zum Baltikum gehört, ist Estnisch keine baltische Sprache, sondern gehört wie Finnisch und Ungarisch zur finno-ugrischen Sprachfamilie. Während Estnisch nur begrenzt Gemeinsamkeiten mit der ungarischen Sprache hat, ist Finnisch für einen Estnisch Muttersprachler aufgrund der vielen Ähnlichkeiten leicht zu verstehen.</p>\n<p>In Estland gibt es drei wichtige Dialekte: den südestnischen Dialekt, das Nordestische und den Nordostküstendialekt. Insgesamt wird Estnisch von gut einer Million Menschen gesprochen. Auch Estland war Teil der Sowjetunion bis 1990, wodurch die estnische Sprache lange Zeit im eigenen Land nur zweitrangig war.

Norwegian (“norsk”) is the mother tongue of approx. 5 million people, and is the official language of Norway.</p>\n<p>There are two official forms of standardised Norwegian: Bokmål (standard Norwegian) and Nynorsk (“New Norwegian”). The third, unofficial form of Norwegian is called Riksmål. Bokmål is used by 85-90% of the Norwegian population, and linguistically speaking is not a separate language; rather a partially Norwegian-ised version of Danish, and is therefore a daughter language of Danish. However, Nynorsk is closely related to the West Scandinavian languages of Faroese and Icelandic. Additionally, both Bokmål and Nynorsk show elements of Swedish. Norwegians, Danes and Swedes find it relatively easy to communicate with one another; Norwegians can understand the Danes and Swedes much more easily than the Swedes can understand the Danes, because of regional changes. The Norwegians also find it relatively easy to communicate with the Faroese and Icelanders.</p>\n<h3>The History of Norwegian</h3>\n<p>Throughout its history, Norwegian has been influenced by a number of very different dialects due to  Norway’s mountainous topography The development of these dialects and Denmark’s centuries-long domination with Danish as an official language meant that Norway was never able to establish an official language comparable to, for example, standard German. There are two official Norwegian written languages, as stated above.</p>\n<p>The origins of Norwegian lie in Old Norse, which displays many great similarities to Icelandic. Because Low German was the lingua franca of the Norwegians during the Hanseatic period, numerous words were borrowed from it. Norway’s position of independence was noticeably weakened by the union between Norway and Denmark, and Norway’s resulting governance by Copenhagen (1380-1814) until Norwegian was replaced by Danish in 1450. The Norwegians perceive this period as being under foreign rule by Denmark - Henrik Ibsen even called it the 400.Year Night.</p>\n<p>Despite the introduction of Danish as the official language, the Norwegian dialects spread across the country continued to be spoken. After the separation of Norway and Denmark, a national Romantic wave developed and with it arose a national movement for the revival of the old Norwegian language. Because by then Danish had been so deeply cemented as an official language, Norwegian was split into two varieties: Riksmål (“standard Norwegian”) and Landsmål (“national language”).</p>\n<p>Until some adjustments were introduced at the beginning of the 20th Century (Dano-Norwegian), Riksmål could more or less be called pure Danish. Landsmål is a language principally developed by the poet and linguist Iyar Aasen in the 1850s from west Norwegian dialects. However, Landsmål is not a planned language because it traces back to closely related, common linguistic roots, rather simply because its natural development to a common language was blocked by external influences.</p>\n<p>Since 1929, Riksmål has officially been called Bokmål, and Landsmål is called Nynorsk.</p>\n<p>Until 1944, there were always new speakers for Nynorsk due to the growing Norwegian national consciousness, and it was always spoken by at least one third of the Norwegian population. Nowadays, this percentage of Nynorsk speakers has fallen to 10-12%. There are several reasons for this: firstly, Nynorsk is perceived as a strange language in urban areas, particularly in Oslo, because the urban middle classes always refused Nynorsk due to it being based on rural dialects. This rendered Nynorsk unable to establish itself properly in the economic and political centres of Norway. Additionally, many inhabitants of the rural regions, especially of eastern Norway, consider Nynorsk to be somewhat artificial because it is effectively the lowest common denominator of the Norwegian dialects. Finally, the grammar of Nynorsk is more difficult than that of Bokmål, which has rendered the spread of Nynorsk amongst the Norwegian population even more difficult.</p>\n<p>However, most Norwegian dialects are more closely related to Nynorsk than to Bokmål, which has phonological, morphological and other grammatical characteristics which are foreign to Norwegian. In 27% of the Norwegian regions and for 12% of the population, Nynorsk is an official language - in the sparsely populated valleys of the west and the mountainous inland. Norway has officially recognised both language forms (Nynorsk and Bokmål), however the country’s language law prohibits authorities from using one of the two languages more than 75% of the time (although this is often ignored in practice), and queries must be answered in both languages.</p>\n<p>The language agreement in the Nordic Council also guarantees that Danish and Swedish are permitted in official correspondence. This agreement counts likewise in Denmark and Sweden.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/Eisenmann-Translations/about/landing\">Home</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Norwegian","type":"pages","category":"Languages","locale":"en","groupingID":26}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/lang/latvian lithuanian estonian/"},"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/joellacey/Contract/Eisenmann-Translations/content/pages/lang/latvian lithuanian estonian/index.md","html":"<h2>Latvian, Lithuanian, Estonian</h2>\n<p>Language combinations for translations involving Latvian, Lithuanian and Estonian:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Latvian to German</li>\n<li>German to Latvian</li>\n<li>Latvian to English</li>\n<li>English to Latvian</li>\n<li>Lithuanian to German</li>\n<li>German to Lithuanian</li>\n<li>Lithuanian to English</li>\n<li>English to Lithuanian</li>\n<li>Estonian to German</li>\n<li>German to Estonian</li>\n<li>Estonian to English</li>\n<li>English to Estonian</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Eisenmann Übersetzungsteam provides technical translations by native speakers of Latvian, Lithuanian and Estonian for all subject areas: economics, law, technology, medicine, advertising, IT etc.</p>\n<p>All texts are translated by experienced specialist translators of Bulgarian into their mother tongues, as per the native speaker principle.</p>\n<p>The only Baltic languages still spoken today are Latvian and Lithuanian; Estonian belongs to the Finno-Ugric language family.
